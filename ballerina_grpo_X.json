A week before ICPC, he broke into Doctor's\nPC and sneaked a look at all the problems that would be given in ICPC. He\nsolved the problems, printed programs out, and brought into ICPC. Since\nelectronic preparation is strictly prohibited, he had to type these programs\nagain during the contest.\n\nAlthough he believes that he can solve every problems thanks to carefully\ndebugged programs, he still has to find an optimal strategy to make certain of\nhis victory.\n\nTeams are ranked by following rules.\n\n  1. Team that solved more problems is ranked higher.\n  2. In case of tie (solved same number of problems), team that received less Penalty is ranked higher.\n\nHere, Penalty is calculated by these rules.\n\n  1. When the team solves a problem, time that the team spent to solve it (i.e. (time of submission) - (time of beginning of the contest)) are added to penalty.\n  2. For each submittion that doesn't solve a problem, 20 minutes of Penalty are added. However, if the problem wasn't solved eventually, Penalty for it is not added.\n\nYou must find that order of solving will affect result of contest. For\nexample, there are three problem named A, B, and C, which takes 10 minutes, 20\nminutes, and 30 minutes to solve, respectively. If you solve A, B, and C in\nthis order, Penalty will be 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 minutes. However, If you do in\nreverse order, 30 + 50 + 60 = 140 minutes of Penalty will be given.\n\nPeter can easily estimate time to need to solve each problem (actually it\ndepends only on length of his program.)

Since the two\nmembers had enormous influence in the family, they were split into two groups.\n\nThey hope that the two groups don't meet each other in the new house. Though\nthey are in the same building, they can avoid to meet each other by adjusting\npassageways.\n\nNow, you have a figure of room layout. Your task is written below.\n\nYou have to decide the two groups each room should belong to. Besides you must\nmake it impossible that they move from any rooms belonging to one group to any\nrooms belonging to the other group. All of the rooms need to belong to exactly\none group.

        "prompt": "# Calculation of Expressions\n\nWrite a program to calculate values of arithmetic expressions which may\ninvolve complex numbers. Details of the expressions are described below.\n\nIn this problem, basic elements of expressions are non-negative integer\nnumbers and the special symbol \"`i`\". Integer numbers are sequences of digits\nof arbitrary length and are in decimal notation. \"`i`\" denotes the unit\nimaginary number _i_ , i.e. _i_ 2 = -1.\n\nOperators appearing in expressions are `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), and\n`*` (multiplication). Division is excluded from the repertoire of the\noperators. All three operators are only used as binary operators. Unary plus\nand minus operators (e.g., `-100`) are also excluded from the repertoire. Note\nthat the multiplication symbol `*` may not be omitted in any case. For\nexample, the expression 1+3 _i_ in mathematics should be written as `1+3*i`.\n\nUsual formation rules of arithmetic expressions apply. Namely, (1) The\noperator `*` binds its operands stronger than the operators `+` and `-`. (2)\nThe operators `+` and `-` have the same strength in operand binding. (3) Two\noperators of the same strength bind from left to right. (4) Parentheses are\nused to designate specific order of binding.\n\nThe consequence of these rules can easily be understood from the following\nexamples.\n\n> > (1) `3+4*5` is `3+(4*5)`, not `(3+4)*5`  \n>  (2) `5-6+7` is `(5-6)+7`, not `5-(6+7)`  \n>  (3) `1+2+3` is `(1+2)+3`, not `1+(2+3)  \n>  `\n\nYour program should successively read expressions, calculate them and print\ntheir results. Overflow should be detected.\n\nWhenever an abnormal value is yielded as a result of applying an operator\nappearing in the given expression, your program should report that the\ncalculation failed due to overflow. By \"an abnormal value\", we mean a value\nwhose real part or imaginary part is greater than 10000 or less than -10000.\nHere are examples:\n\n`10000+1+(0-10)` | overflow, not 9991  \n---|---  \n`(10*i+100)*(101+20*i)` | 9900+3010 _i_ , not overflow  \n`4000000-4000000` | overflow, not 0  \n  \nNote that the law of associativity does not necessarily hold in this problem.\nFor example, in the first example, overflow is detected by interpreting the\nexpression as `(10000+1)+(0-10)` following the binding rules, whereas overflow\ncould not be detected if you interpreted it as `10000+(1+(0-10))`. Moreover,\noverflow detection should take place for resulting value of each operation.\n\nIn the second example, a value which exceeds 10000 appears in the calculation\nprocess of one multiplication if you use the mathematical rule\n\n> (_a_ +_b i_)(_c_ +_d_ _i_)=(_ac_ -_bd_)+(_ad_ +_bc_)_i_.\n\nBut the yielded result 9900+3010 _i_ does not contain any number which exceeds\n10000 and, therefore, overflow should not be reported.\n\n## Input\n\nA sequence of lines each of which contains an expression is given as input.\nEach line consists of less than 100 characters and does not contain any blank\nspaces. You may assume that all expressions given in the sequence are\nsyntactically correct.\n\n## Output\n\nYour program should produce output for each expression line by line. If\noverflow is detected, output should be a character string \"`overflow`\".\nOtherwise, output should be the resulting value of calculation in the\nfollowing fashion.\n\n  * `0` , if the result is 0+0 _i_. \n  * `-123` , if the result is -123+0 _i_. \n  * `45i` , if the result is 0+45 _i_. \n  * `3+1i` , if the result is 3+_i_. \n  * `123-45i` , if the result is 123-45 _i_. \n\nOutput should not contain any blanks, surplus `0`, `+`, or `-`.\n\n## Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    (1-10*i)+00007+(3+10*i)\n    3+4*i*(4+10*i)\n    (102+10*i)*(99+10*i)\n    2*i+3+9999*i+4\n    \n\n## Output for the Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    11\n    -37+16i\n    9998+2010i\n    overflow\n    \n\n",

        "prompt": "# Problem A: Ohgas' Fortune\n\nThe Ohgas are a prestigious family based on Hachioji. The head of the family,\nMr. Nemochi Ohga, a famous wealthy man, wishes to increase his fortune by\ndepositing his money to an operation company. You are asked to help Mr. Ohga\nmaximize his profit by operating the given money during a specified period.\n\nFrom a given list of possible operations, you choose an operation to deposit\nthe given fund to. You commit on the single operation throughout the period\nand deposit all the fund to it. Each operation specifies an annual interest\nrate, whether the interest is simple or compound, and an annual operation\ncharge. An annual operation charge is a constant not depending on the balance\nof the fund. The amount of interest is calculated at the end of every year, by\nmultiplying the balance of the fund under operation by the annual interest\nrate, and then rounding off its fractional part. For compound interest, it is\nadded to the balance of the fund under operation, and thus becomes a subject\nof interest for the following years. For simple interest, on the other hand,\nit is saved somewhere else and does not enter the balance of the fund under\noperation (i.e. it is not a subject of interest in the following years). An\noperation charge is then subtracted from the balance of the fund under\noperation. You may assume here that you can always pay the operation charge\n(i.e. the balance of the fund under operation is never less than the operation\ncharge). The amount of money you obtain after the specified years of operation\nis called ``the final amount of fund.'' For simple interest, it is the sum of\nthe balance of the fund under operation at the end of the final year, plus the\namount of interest accumulated throughout the period. For compound interest,\nit is simply the balance of the fund under operation at the end of the final\nyear.\n\nOperation companies use C, C++, Java, etc., to perform their calculations, so\nthey pay a special attention to their interest rates. That is, in these\ncompanies, an interest rate is always an integral multiple of 0.0001220703125\nand between 0.0001220703125 and 0.125 (inclusive). 0.0001220703125 is a\ndecimal representation of 1/8192. Thus, interest rates' being its multiples\nmeans that they can be represented with no errors under the double-precision\nbinary representation of floating-point numbers.\n\nFor example, if you operate 1000000 JPY for five years with an annual,\ncompound interest rate of 0.03125 (3.125 %) and an annual operation charge of\n3000 JPY, the balance changes as follows.\n\nThe balance of the fund under operation (at the beginning of year) | Interest|  The balance of the fund under operation (at the end of year)  \n---|---|---  \nA| B = A \u00d7 0.03125 (and rounding off fractions) | A + B - 3000  \n1000000| 31250| 1028250  \n1028250| 32132| 1057382  \n1057382| 33043| 1087425  \n1087425| 33982| 1118407  \n1118407| 34950| 1150357  \n  \nAfter the five years of operation, the final amount of fund is 1150357 JPY.\n\nIf the interest is simple with all other parameters being equal, it looks\nlike:\n\nThe balance of the fund under operation (at the beginning of year) | Interest | The balance of the fund under operation (at the end of year) | Cumulative interest   \n---|---|---|---  \nA| B = A \u00d7 0.03125 (and rounding off fractions)| A - 3000|  \n1000000| 31250| 997000| 31250  \n997000| 31156| 994000| 62406  \n994000| 31062| 991000| 93468  \n991000| 30968| 988000| 124436  \n988000| 30875| 985000| 155311  \n  \nIn this case the final amount of fund is the total of the fund under\noperation, 985000 JPY, and the cumulative interests, 155311 JPY, which is\n1140311 JPY.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input consists of datasets. The entire input looks like:\n\n> _the number of datasets (=m)_  \n>  _1st dataset_  \n>  _2nd dataset_  \n>  ...  \n>  _m-th dataset_  \n>\n\nThe number of datasets, _m_ , is no more than 100. Each dataset is formatted\nas follows.\n\n> _the initial amount of the fund for operation_  \n>  _the number of years of operation_  \n>  _the number of available operations (=n)_  \n>  _operation 1_  \n>  _operation 2_  \n>  ...  \n>  _operation n_  \n>\n\nThe initial amount of the fund for operation, the number of years of\noperation, and the number of available operations are all positive integers.\nThe first is no more than 100000000, the second no more than 10, and the third\nno more than 100.\n\nEach ``operation'' is formatted as follows.\n\n> _simple-or-compound annual-interest-rate annual-operation-charge_\n\nwhere _simple-or-compound_ is a single character of either '0' or '1', with\n'0' indicating simple interest and '1' compound. _annual-interest-rate_ is\nrepresented by a decimal fraction and is an integral multiple of 1/8192.\n_annual-operation-charge_ is an integer not exceeding 100000.\n\n## Output\n\nFor each dataset, print a line having a decimal integer indicating the final\namount of fund for the best operation.

The number of judges may differ from one\ncontestant to another, because judges with any relationship whatsoever with a\nspecific contestant are temporarily excluded for scoring his/her performance.\n\nBasically, scores given to a contestant's performance by the judges are\naveraged to decide his/her score. To avoid letting judges with eccentric\nviewpoints too much influence the score, the highest and the lowest scores are\nset aside in this calculation. If the same highest score is marked by two or\nmore judges, only one of them is ignored. The same is with the lowest score.\nThe average, which may contain fractions, are truncated down to obtain final\nscore as an integer.\n\nYou are asked to write a program that computes the scores of performances,\ngiven the scores of all the judges, to speed up the event to be suited for a\nTV program.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input consists of a number of datasets, each corresponding to a\ncontestant's performance. There are no more than 20 datasets in the input.\n\nA dataset begins with a line with an integer _n_ , the number of judges\nparticipated in scoring the performance (3 \u2264 _n_ \u2264 100). Each of the _n_ lines\nfollowing it has an integral score _s_ (0 \u2264 _s_ \u2264 1000) marked by a judge. No\nother characters except for digits to express these numbers are in the input.\nJudges' names are kept secret.\n\nThe end of the input is indicated by a line with a single zero in it.\n\n## Output\n\nFor each dataset, a line containing a single decimal integer indicating the\nscore for the corresponding performance should be output.

        "prompt": "# Problem B: Monday-Saturday Prime Factors\n\nChief Judge's log, stardate 48642.5. We have decided to make a problem from\nelementary number theory. The problem looks like finding all prime factors of\na positive integer, but it is not.\n\nA positive integer whose remainder divided by 7 is either 1 or 6 is called a\n7** _N_** +{1,6} number. But as it is hard to pronounce, we shall call it a\n_Monday-Saturday number_.\n\nFor Monday-Saturday numbers _a_ and _b_ , we say _a_ is a Monday-Saturday\ndivisor of _b_ if there exists a Monday-Saturday number _x_ such that _a_ _x_\n= _b_. It is easy to show that for any Monday-Saturday numbers _a_ and _b_ ,\nit holds that _a_ is a Monday-Saturday divisor of _b_ if and only if _a_ is a\ndivisor of _b_ in the usual sense.\n\nWe call a Monday-Saturday number a _Monday-Saturday prime_ if it is greater\nthan 1 and has no Monday-Saturday divisors other than itself and 1. A Monday-\nSaturday number which is a prime in the usual sense is a Monday-Saturday prime\nbut the converse does not always hold. For example, 27 is a Monday-Saturday\nprime although it is not a prime in the usual sense. We call a Monday-Saturday\nprime which is a Monday-Saturday divisor of a Monday-Saturday number _a_ a\n_Monday-Saturday prime factor_ of _a_. For example, 27 is one of the Monday-\nSaturday prime factors of 216, since 27 is a Monday-Saturday prime and 216 =\n27 \u00d7 8 holds.\n\nAny Monday-Saturday number greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of one\nor more Monday-Saturday primes. The expression is not always unique even if\ndifferences in order are ignored. For example,  216 = 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 8 \u00d7 27\nholds.\n\nOur contestants should write a program that outputs all Monday-Saturday prime\nfactors of each input Monday-Saturday number.\n\n### Input\n\nThe input is a sequence of lines each of which contains a single Monday-\nSaturday number. Each Monday-Saturday number is greater than 1 and less than\n300000 (three hundred thousand). The end of the input is indicated by a line\ncontaining a single digit 1.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each input Monday-Saturday number, it should be printed, followed by a\ncolon `:' and the list of its Monday-Saturday prime factors on a single line.\nMonday-Saturday prime factors should be listed in ascending order and each\nshould be preceded by a space. All the Monday-Saturday prime factors should be\nprinted only once even if they divide the input Monday-Saturday number more\nthan once.\n\n### Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    205920\n    262144\n    262200\n    279936\n    299998\n    1\n    \n\n### Output for the Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    205920: 6 8 13 15 20 22 55 99\n    262144: 8\n    262200: 6 8 15 20 50 57 69 76 92 190 230 475 575 874 2185\n    279936: 6 8 27\n    299998: 299998\n    \n\n",

Today we are visiting his studio to see how his\nmasterpieces are given birth.\n\nAt the center of his studio, there is a huuuuuge table and beside it are many,\nmany squares of the same size. Pablo Squarson puts one of the squares on the\ntable. Then he places some other squares on the table in sequence. It seems\nhis methodical nature forces him to place each square side by side to the one\nthat he already placed on, with machine-like precision.\n\nOh! The first piece of artwork is done. Pablo Squarson seems satisfied with\nit. Look at his happy face.\n\nOh, what's wrong with Pablo? He is tearing his hair! Oh, I see. He wants to\nfind a box that fits the new piece of work but he has trouble figuring out its\nsize. Let's help him!\n\nYour mission is to write a program that takes instructions that record how\nPablo made a piece of his artwork and computes its width and height. It is\nknown that the size of each square is 1. You may assume that Pablo does not\nput a square on another.\n\nI hear someone murmured \"A smaller box will do\". No, poor Pablo, shaking his\nhead, is grumbling \"My square style does not seem to be understood by\nilliterates\".\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_D2010_A-1)\n\n### Input\n\nThe input consists of a number of datasets. Each dataset represents the way\nPablo made a piece of his artwork. The format of a dataset is as follows.\n\n> N  \n>  n1 d1  \n>  n2 d2  \n>  ...  \n>  nN-1 dN-1  \n>\n\nThe first line contains the number of squares (= N) used to make the piece of\nartwork. The number is a positive integer and is smaller than 200.\n\nThe remaining (N-1) lines in the dataset are square placement instructions.\nThe line \"ni di\" indicates placement of the square numbered i (\u2264 N-1). The\nrules of numbering squares are as follows. The first square is numbered\n\"zero\". Subsequently placed squares are numbered 1, 2, ..., (N-1). Note that\nthe input does not give any placement instruction to the first square, which\nis numbered zero.\n\nA square placement instruction for the square numbered i, namely \"ni di\",\ndirects it to be placed next to the one that is numbered ni, towards the\ndirection given by di, which denotes leftward (= 0), downward (= 1), rightward\n(= 2), and upward (= 3).\n\nFor example, pieces of artwork corresponding to the four datasets shown in\n**Sample Input** are depicted below. Squares are labeled by their numbers.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_D2010_A-2)\n\nThe end of the input is indicated by a line that contains a single zero.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each dataset, output a line that contains the width and the height of the\npiece of artwork as decimal numbers, separated by a space.

        "prompt": "# Problem D: Off Balance\n\nYou are working for an administration office of the International Center for\nPicassonian Cubism (ICPC), which plans to build a new art gallery for young\nartists. The center is organizing an architectural design competition to find\nthe best design for the new building.\n\nSubmitted designs will look like a screenshot of a well known game as shown\nbelow.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_D2010_D-1)\n\nThis is because the center specifies that the building should be constructed\nby stacking regular units called _pieces_ , each of which consists of four\ncubic blocks. In addition, the center requires the competitors to submit\ndesigns that satisfy the following restrictions.\n\n  * All the pieces are aligned. When two pieces touch each other, the faces of the touching blocks must be placed exactly at the same position. \n  * All the pieces are stable. Since pieces are merely stacked, their centers of masses must be carefully positioned so as not to collapse. \n  * The pieces are stacked in a tree-like form in order to symbolize boundless potentiality of young artists. In other words, one and only one piece touches the ground, and each of other pieces touches one and only one piece on its bottom faces. \n  * The building has a flat shape. This is because the construction site is a narrow area located between a straight moat and an expressway where no more than one block can be placed between the moat and the expressway as illustrated below. \n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_D2010_D-2)\n\nIt will take many days to fully check stability of designs as it requires\ncomplicated structural calculation. Therefore, you are asked to quickly check\nobviously unstable designs by focusing on centers of masses. The rules of your\nquick check are as follows.\n\nAssume the center of mass of a block is located at the center of the block,\nand all blocks have the same weight. We denote a location of a block by _xy_\n-coordinates of its left-bottom corner. The unit length is the edge length of\na block.\n\nAmong the blocks of the piece that touch another piece or the ground on their\nbottom faces, let _x L_ be the leftmost _x_ -coordinate of the leftmost block,\nand let _x R_ be the rightmost _x_ -coordinate of the rightmost block. Let the\n_x_ -coordinate of its accumulated center of mass of the piece be _M_ , where\nthe accumulated center of mass of a piece _P_ is the center of the mass of the\npieces that are directly and indirectly supported by _P_ , in addition to _P_\nitself. Then the piece is stable, if and only if _x L_ < _M_ < _x R_.\nOtherwise, it is unstable. A design of a building is unstable if any of its\npieces is unstable.\n\nNote that the above rules could judge some designs to be unstable even if it\nwould not collapse in reality. For example, the left one of the following\ndesigns shall be judged to be unstable.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_D2010_D-3) |  | ![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_D2010_D-4)  \n---|---|---  \n  \nAlso note that the rules judge boundary cases to be unstable. For example, the\ntop piece in the above right design has its center of mass exactly above the\nright end of the bottom piece. This shall be judged to be unstable.\n\nWrite a program that judges stability of each design based on the above quick\ncheck rules.\n\n### Input\n\nThe input is a sequence of datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a\nline containing two zeros separated by a space. Each dataset, which represents\na front view of a building, is formatted as follows.\n\n> _w h_  \n>  _p_ 0(_h_ -1)_p_ 1(_h_ -1)..._p_(_w_ -1)(_h_ -1)  \n>  ...  \n>  _p_ 01 _p_ 11..._p_(_w_ -1)1  \n>  _p_ 00 _p_ 10..._p_(_w_ -1)0  \n>\n\nThe integers _w_ and _h_ separated by a space are the numbers of columns and\nrows of the layout, respectively. You may assume 1 \u2264 _w_ \u2264 10 and 1 \u2264 _h_ \u2264\n60\\. The next _h_ lines specify the placement of the pieces. The character _p\nxy_ indicates the status of a block at (_x_ ,_y_), either ``.`', meaning\nempty, or one digit character between ``1`' and ``9`', inclusive, meaning a\nblock of a piece. (As mentioned earlier, we denote a location of a block by\n_xy_ -coordinates of its left-bottom corner.)\n\nWhen two blocks with the same number touch each other by any of their top,\nbottom, left or right face, those blocks are of the same piece. (Note that\nthere might be two different pieces that are denoted by the same number.) The\nbottom of a block at (_x_ ,0) touches the ground.\n\nYou may assume that the pieces in each dataset are stacked in a tree-like\nform.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each dataset, output a line containing a word `STABLE` when the design is\nstable with respect to the above quick check rules. Otherwise, output\n`UNSTABLE`. The output should be written with uppercase letters, and should\nnot contain any other extra characters.\n\n### Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    4 5\n    ..33\n    ..33\n    2222\n    ..1.\n    .111\n    5 7\n    ....1\n    .1..1\n    .1..1\n    11..1\n    .2222\n    ..111\n    ...1.\n    3 6\n    .3.\n    233\n    23.\n    22.\n    .11\n    .11\n    4 3\n    2222\n    ..11\n    ..11\n    4 5\n    .3..\n    33..\n    322.\n    2211\n    .11.\n    3 3\n    222\n    2.1\n    111\n    3 4\n    11.\n    11.\n    .2.\n    222\n    3 4\n    .11\n    .11\n    .2.\n    222\n    2 7\n    11\n    .1\n    21\n    22\n    23\n    .3\n    33\n    2 3\n    1.\n    11\n    .1\n    0 0\n    \n\n### Output for the Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    STABLE\n    STABLE\n    STABLE\n    UNSTABLE\n    STABLE\n    STABLE\n    UNSTABLE\n    UNSTABLE\n    UNSTABLE\n    UNSTABLE\n    \n\n",

Let us make a sequence using this fact.\n\nA non-negative integer _a_ 0 and the number of digits _L_ are given first.\nApplying the following rules, we obtain _a_ _i_ +1 from _a_ _i_.\n\n  1. Express the integer _a_ _i_ in decimal notation with _L_ digits. Leading zeros are added if necessary. For example, the decimal notation with six digits of the number 2012 is 002012. \n  2. Rearranging the digits, find the largest possible integer and the smallest possible integer; In the example above, the largest possible integer is 221000 and the smallest is 000122 = 122. \n  3. A new integer _a_ _i_ +1 is obtained by subtracting the smallest possible integer from the largest. In the example above, we obtain 220878 subtracting 122 from 221000. \n\nWhen you repeat this calculation, you will get a sequence of integers _a_ 0 ,\n_a_ 1 , _a_ 2 , ... .\n\nFor example, starting with the integer 83268 and with the number of digits 6,\nyou will get the following sequence of integers _a_ 0 , _a_ 1 , _a_ 2 , ... .\n\n> _a_ 0 = 083268  \n>  _a_ 1 = 886320 \u2212 023688 = 862632  \n>  _a_ 2 = 866322 \u2212 223668 = 642654  \n>  _a_ 3 = 665442 \u2212 244566 = 420876  \n>  _a_ 4 = 876420 \u2212 024678 = 851742  \n>  _a_ 5 = 875421 \u2212 124578 = 750843  \n>  _a_ 6 = 875430 \u2212 034578 = 840852  \n>  _a_ 7 = 885420 \u2212 024588 = 860832  \n>  _a_ 8 = 886320 \u2212 023688 = 862632  \n>     \u2026  \n>\n\nBecause the number of digits to express integers is fixed, you will encounter\noccurrences of the same integer in the sequence _a_ 0 , _a_ 1 , _a_ 2 , ...\neventually.

        "prompt": "### ICPC Ranking\n\nYour mission in this problem is to write a program which, given the submission\nlog of an ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest), determines team\nrankings.\n\nThe log is a sequence of records of program submission in the order of\nsubmission. A record has four fields: elapsed time, team number, problem\nnumber, and judgment. The elapsed time is the time elapsed from the beginning\nof the contest to the submission. The judgment field tells whether the\nsubmitted program was correct or incorrect, and when incorrect, what kind of\nan error was found.\n\nThe team ranking is determined according to the following rules. Note that the\nrule set shown here is one used in the real ICPC World Finals and Regionals,\nwith some detail rules omitted for simplification.\n\n  1. Teams that solved more problems are ranked higher. \n  2. Among teams that solve the same number of problems, ones with smaller total consumed time are ranked higher. \n  3. If two or more teams solved the same number of problems, and their total consumed times are the same, they are ranked the same. \n\nThe total consumed time is the sum of the consumed time for each problem\nsolved. The consumed time for a solved problem is the elapsed time of the\naccepted submission plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected\nsubmission for that problem.\n\nIf a team did not solve a problem, the consumed time for the problem is zero,\nand thus even if there are several incorrect submissions, no penalty is given.\n\nYou can assume that a team never submits a program for a problem after the\ncorrect submission for the same problem.\n\n### Input\n\nThe input is a sequence of datasets each in the following format. The last\ndataset is followed by a line with four zeros.\n\n> _M_ _T_ _P_ _R_  \n>  _m_ 1 _t_ 1 _p_ 1 _j_ 1  \n>  _m_ 2 _t_ 2 _p_ 2 _j_ 2  \n>  .....  \n>  _m R_ _t R_ _p R_ _j R_  \n>\n\nThe first line of a dataset contains four integers _M_ , _T_ , _P_ , and _R_.\n_M_ is the duration of the contest. _T_ is the number of teams. _P_ is the\nnumber of problems. _R_ is the number of submission records. The relations 120\n\u2264 _M_  \u2264 300, 1 \u2264 _T_  \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 _P_  \u2264 10, and 0 \u2264 _R_  \u2264 2000 hold for these\nvalues. Each team is assigned a team number between 1 and _T_ , inclusive.\nEach problem is assigned a problem number between 1 and _P_ , inclusive.\n\nEach of the following _R_ lines contains a submission record with four\nintegers _m k_, _t k_, _p k_, and _j k_ (1 \u2264 _k_  \u2264 _R_). _m k_ is the elapsed\ntime. _t k_ is the team number. _p k_ is the problem number. _j k_ is the\njudgment (0 means correct, and other values mean incorrect). The relations 0 \u2264\n_m k_ \u2264 _M_ \u22121, 1 \u2264 _t k_ \u2264 _T_ , 1 \u2264 _p k_ \u2264 _P_ , and 0 \u2264 _j k_ \u2264 10 hold\nfor these values.\n\nThe elapsed time fields are rounded off to the nearest minute.\n\nSubmission records are given in the order of submission. Therefore, if _i_  <\n_j_ , the _i_ -th submission is done before the _j_ -th submission (_m i_ \u2264 _m\nj_). In some cases, you can determine the ranking of two teams with a\ndifference less than a minute, by using this fact. However, such a fact is\nnever used in the team ranking. Teams are ranked only using time information\nin minutes.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each dataset, your program should output team numbers (from 1 to _T_),\nhigher ranked teams first. The separator between two team numbers should be a\ncomma. When two teams are ranked the same, the separator between them should\nbe an equal sign. Teams ranked the same should be listed in decreasing order\nof their team numbers.\n\n### Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    300 10 8 5\n    50 5 2 1\n    70 5 2 0\n    75 1 1 0\n    100 3 1 0\n    150 3 2 0\n    240 5 5 7\n    50 1 1 0\n    60 2 2 0\n    70 2 3 0\n    90 1 3 0\n    120 3 5 0\n    140 4 1 0\n    150 2 4 1\n    180 3 5 4\n    15 2 2 1\n    20 2 2 1\n    25 2 2 0\n    60 1 1 0\n    120 5 5 4\n    15 5 4 1\n    20 5 4 0\n    40 1 1 0\n    40 2 2 0\n    120 2 3 4\n    30 1 1 0\n    40 2 1 0\n    50 2 2 0\n    60 1 2 0\n    120 3 3 2\n    0 1 1 0\n    1 2 2 0\n    300 5 8 0\n    0 0 0 0\n    \n\n### Output for the Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    3,1,5,10=9=8=7=6=4=2\n    2,1,3,4,5\n    1,2,3\n    5=2=1,4=3\n    2=1\n    1,2,3\n    5=4=3=2=1\n    \n\n",

There are exactly two presidential candidates.\n  2. At the first stage, eligible voters go to the polls of his/her electoral district. The winner of the district is the candidate who takes a majority of the votes. Voters cast their ballots only at this first stage.\n  3. A district of the _k_ -th stage (_k_ > 1) consists of multiple districts of the (_k_ \u2212 1)-th stage. In contrast, a district of the (_k_ \u2212 1)-th stage is a sub-district of one and only one district of the _k_ -th stage. The winner of a district of the _k_ -th stage is the candidate who wins in a majority of its sub-districts of the (_k_ \u2212 1)-th stage.\n  4. The final stage has just one nation-wide district. The winner of the final stage is chosen as the president.\n\nYou can assume the following about the presidential election of this country.\n\n  * Every eligible voter casts a vote.\n  * The number of the eligible voters of each electoral district of the first stage is odd.\n  * The number of the sub-districts of the (_k_ \u2212 1)-th stage that constitute a district of the _k_ -th stage (_k_ > 1) is also odd.\n\nThis means that each district of every stage has its winner (there is no tie).\n\nYour mission is to write a program that finds a way to win the presidential\nelection with the minimum number of votes. Suppose, for instance, that the\ndistrict of the final stage has three sub-districts of the first stage and\nthat the numbers of the eligible voters of the sub-districts are 123, 4567,\nand 89, respectively. The minimum number of votes required to be the winner is\n107, that is, 62 from the first district and 45 from the third. In this case,\neven if the other candidate were given all the 4567 votes in the second\ndistrict, s/he would inevitably be the loser. Although you might consider this\nelection system unfair, you should accept it as a reality.\n\n### Input\n\nThe entire input looks like:\n\n> _the number of datasets (=n)_  \n>  _1st dataset_  \n>  _2nd dataset_  \n>  \u2026  \n>  _n-th dataset_  \n>\n\nThe number of datasets, _n_ , is no more than 100.\n\nThe number of the eligible voters of each district and the part-whole\nrelations among districts are denoted as follows.\n\n  * An electoral district of the first stage is denoted as [_c_], where _c_ is the number of the eligible voters of the district.\n  * A district of the _k_ -th stage (_k_ > 1) is denoted as [_d_ 1 _d_ 2\u2026 _d m_], where _d_ 1, _d_ 2, \u2026, _d m_ denote its sub-districts of the (_k_ \u2212 1)-th stage in this notation.\n\nFor instance, an electoral district of the first stage that has 123 eligible\nvoters is denoted as [123]. A district of the second stage consisting of three\nsub-districts of the first stage that have 123, 4567, and 89 eligible voters,\nrespectively, is denoted as [[123][4567][89]].\n\nEach dataset is a line that contains the character string denoting the\ndistrict of the final stage in the aforementioned notation. You can assume the\nfollowing.\n\n  * The character string in each dataset does not include any characters except digits ('0', '1', \u2026, '9') and square brackets ('[', ']'), and its length is between 11 and 10000, inclusive.\n  * The number of the eligible voters of each electoral district of the first stage is between 3 and 9999, inclusive.\n\nThe number of stages is a nation-wide constant. So, for instance,\n[[[9][9][9]][9][9]] never appears in the input. [[[[9]]]] may not appear\neither since each district of the second or later stage must have multiple\nsub-districts of the previous stage.\n\n### Output\n\nFor each dataset, print the minimum number of votes required to be the winner\nof the presidential election in a line.

Nevertheless, last night, he attended to the meeting of Immortal and\nCorpse Programmers Circle, and he has to go home in the near dawn.\nFortunately, there are many tall buildings around Mr. C's home, and while the\nsunlight is blocked by the buildings, he can move around safely. The top end\nof the sun has just reached the horizon now. In how many seconds does Mr. C\nhave to go into his safe coffin?\n\nTo simplify the problem, we represent the eastern dawn sky as a 2-dimensional\n_x_ -_y_ plane, where the _x_ axis is horizontal and the _y_ axis is vertical,\nand approximate building silhouettes by rectangles and the sun by a circle on\nthis plane.\n\nThe _x_ axis represents the horizon. We denote the time by _t_ , and the\ncurrent time is _t_ =0. The radius of the sun is _r_ and its center is at (0,\n-_r_) when the time _t_ =0. The sun moves on the _x_ -_y_ plane in a uniform\nlinear motion at a constant velocity of (0, 1) per second.\n\nThe sunlight is blocked if and only if the entire region of the sun (including\nits edge) is included in the union of the silhouettes (including their edges)\nand the region below the horizon (y \u2264 0).\n\nWrite a program that computes the time of the last moment when the sunlight is\nblocked.\n\nThe following figure shows the layout of silhouettes and the position of the\nsun at the last moment when the sunlight is blocked, that corresponds to the\nfirst dataset of Sample Input below.

(1 \u2264 _r_ \u2264 20, 0 \u2264 _n_\n\u2264 20)\n\nEach of following _n_ lines contains three integers _x li_, _x ri_, _h i_ (1 \u2264\n_i_ \u2264 _n_) separated by a space.\n\nThese three integers represent a silhouette rectangle of a building. The\nsilhouette rectangle is parallel to the horizon, and its left and right edges\nare at _x_ = _x li_ and _x_ = _x ri_, its top edge is at _y_ = _h i_, and its\nbottom edge is on the horizon.

The company ACMICPC has several\ncollections for locations of antennas as their candidate plans, and now they\nwant to know which collection is the best choice.\n\nfor this purpose, they want to develop a computer program to find the coverage\nof a collection of antenna locations. Each antenna _A i_ has power _r i_,\ncorresponding to \"radius\". Usually, the coverage region of the antenna may be\nmodeled as a disk centered at the location of the antenna (_x i, yi_) with\nradius _r i_. However, in this city Maxnorm such a coverage region becomes the\nsquare [_x i_ \u2212 _r i_, _x i_ \\+ _r i_] \u00d7 [_y i_ \u2212 _r i_, _y i_ \\+ _r i_]. In\nother words, the distance between two points (_x p_, _y p_) and (_x q_, _y q_)\nis measured by the max norm max{ |_x p_ \u2212 _x q_|, |_y p_ \u2212 _y q_|}, or, the\n_L_ \u221e norm, in this city Maxnorm instead of the ordinary Euclidean norm \u221a {(_x\np_ \u2212 _x q_)2 \\+ (_y p_ \u2212 _y q_)2}.\n\nAs an example, consider the following collection of 3 antennas\n\n    \n    \n    4.0 4.0 3.0\n    5.0 6.0 3.0\n    5.5 4.5 1.0\n    \n\ndepicted in the following figure\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE1_mobilePhone)\n\nwhere the _i_ -th row represents _x i, yi ri_ such that (_x i, yi_) is the\nposition of the _i_ -th antenna and _r i_ is its power.

        "prompt": "# Problem A: Starship Hakodate-maru\n\nThe surveyor starship Hakodate-maru is famous for her two fuel containers with\nunbounded capacities. They hold the same type of atomic fuel balls.\n\nThere, however, is an inconvenience. The shapes of the fuel containers _#_ 1\nand _#_ 2 are always cubic and regular tetrahedral respectively. Both of the\nfuel containers should be either empty or filled according to their shapes.\nOtherwise, the fuel balls become extremely unstable and may explode in the\nfuel containers. Thus, the number of fuel balls for the container _#_ 1 should\nbe a cubic number (_n_ 3 for some _n_ = 0, 1, 2, 3,... ) and that for the\ncontainer _#_ 2 should be a tetrahedral number ( _n_(_n_ \\+ 1)(_n_ \\+ 2)/6 for\nsome _n_ = 0, 1, 2, 3,... ).\n\nHakodate-maru is now at the star base Goryokaku preparing for the next mission\nto create a precise and detailed chart of stars and interstellar matters. Both\nof the fuel containers are now empty. Commander Parus of Goryokaku will soon\nsend a message to Captain Future of Hakodate-maru on how many fuel balls\nGoryokaku can supply. Captain Future should quickly answer to Commander Parus\non how many fuel balls she requests before her ship leaves Goryokaku. Of\ncourse, Captain Future and her omcers want as many fuel balls as possible.\n\nFor example, consider the case Commander Parus offers 151200 fuel balls. If\nonly the fuel container _#_ 1 were available (i.e. ifthe fuel container _#_ 2\nwere unavailable), at most 148877 fuel balls could be put into the fuel\ncontainer since 148877 = 53 \u00d7 53 \u00d7 53 < 151200 < 54 \u00d7 54 \u00d7 54 . If only the\nfuel container _#_ 2 were available, at most 147440 fuel balls could be put\ninto the fuel container since 147440 = 95 \u00d7 96 \u00d7 97/6 < 151200 < 96 \u00d7 97 \u00d7\n98/6 . Using both of the fuel containers _#_ 1 and _#_ 2, 151200 fuel balls\ncan be put into the fuel containers since 151200 = 39 \u00d7 39 \u00d7 39 + 81 \u00d7 82 \u00d7\n83/6 . In this case, Captain Future's answer should be \"151200\".\n\nCommander Parus's offer cannot be greater than 151200 because of the capacity\nof the fuel storages of Goryokaku. Captain Future and her omcers know that\nwell.\n\nYou are a fuel engineer assigned to Hakodate-maru. Your duty today is to help\nCaptain Future with calculating the number of fuel balls she should request.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input is a sequence of at most 1024 positive integers. Each line contains\na single integer. The sequence is followed by a zero, which indicates the end\nof data and should not be treated as input. You may assume that none of the\ninput integers is greater than 151200.\n\n## Output\n\nThe output is composed of lines, each containing a single integer. Each output\ninteger should be the greatest integer that is the sum of a nonnegative cubic\nnumber and a nonnegative tetrahedral number and that is not greater than the\ncorresponding input number.

The edges of each small triangle are of\nthe same length.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE1_lifeline1)\n\nFigure 1: The board\n\nThe size of the board is expressed by the number of vertices on the bottom\nedge of the outer triangle. For example, the size of the board in Figure 1 is\n4.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player is assigned his own identification\nnumber between 1 and 9, and is given some stones on which his identification\nnumber is written.\n\nEach player puts his stone in turn on one of the ``empty'' vertices. An\n``empty vertex'' is a vertex that has no stone on it.\n\nWhen one player puts his stone on one of the vertices during his turn, some\nstones might be removed from the board. The player gains points which is equal\nto the number of the removed stones of others, but loses points which is equal\nto the number of the removed stones of himself. The points of a player for a\nsingle turn is the points he gained minus the points he lost in that turn.\n\nThe conditions for removing stones are as follows:\n\n  * The stones on the board are divided into groups. Each group contains a set of stones whose numbers are the same and placed adjacently. That is, if the same numbered stones are placed adjacently, they belong to the same group. \n  * If none of the stones in a group is adjacent to at least one ``empty'' vertex, all the stones in that group are removed from the board. \n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE1_lifeline2)\n\nFigure 2: The groups of stones\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of the groups of stones.\n\nSuppose that the turn of the player `4' comes now. If he puts his stone on the\nvertex shown in Figure 3a, the conditions will be satisfied to remove some\ngroups of stones (shadowed in Figure 3b).

The\nplayer gains 4 points, because the 4 stones of others are removed. But, at the\nsame time, he loses 3 points, because his 3 stones are removed. As the result,\nthe player's points of this turn is 4 - 3 = 1 (See Figure 4c).\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE1_lifeline4) Figure 4a | Figure 4b | Figure 4c  \n---|---|---  \n  \nWhen each player puts all of his stones on the board, the game is over.

        "prompt": "# Problem E: Map of Ninja House\n\nAn old document says that a Ninja House in Kanazawa City was in fact a\ndefensive fortress, which was designed like a maze. Its rooms were connected\nby hidden doors in a complicated manner, so that any invader would become\nlost. Each room has at least two doors.\n\nThe Ninja House can be modeled by a graph, as shown in Figure l. A circle\nrepresents a room. Each line connecting two circles represents a door between\ntwo rooms.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE1_ninjahouse) Figure l. Graph Model of Ninja House.  |  Figure 2. Ninja House exploration.   \n---|---  \n  \nI decided to draw a map, since no map was available. Your mission is to help\nme draw a map from the record of my exploration.\n\nI started exploring by entering a single entrance that was open to the\noutside. The path I walked is schematically shown in Figure 2, by a line with\narrows. The rules for moving between rooms are described below.\n\nAfter entering a room, I first open the rightmost door and move to the next\nroom. However, if the next room has already been visited, I close the door\nwithout entering, and open the next rightmost door, and so on. When I have\ninspected all the doors of a room, I go back through the door I used to enter\nthe room.\n\nI have a counter with me to memorize the distance from the first room. The\ncounter is incremented when I enter a new room, and decremented when I go back\nfrom a room. In Figure 2, each number in parentheses is the value of the\ncounter when I have entered the room, i.e., the distance from the first room.\nIn contrast, the numbers not in parentheses represent the order of my visit.\n\nI take a record of my exploration. Every time I open a door, I record a single\nnumber, according to the following rules.\n\n  1. If the opposite side of the door is a new room, I record the number of doors in that room, which is a positive number.\n  2. If it is an already visited room, say R, I record ``_the distance of R from the first room_ '' minus ``_the distance of the current room from the first room_ '', which is a negative number.\n\nIn the example shown in Figure 2, as the first room has three doors connecting\nother rooms, I initially record ``3''. Then when I move to the second, third,\nand fourth rooms, which all have three doors, I append ``3 3 3'' to the\nrecord. When I skip the entry from the fourth room to the first room, the\ndistance difference ``-3'' (minus three) will be appended, and so on. So, when\nI finish this exploration, its record is a sequence of numbers ``3 3 3 3 -3 3\n2 -5 3 2 -5 -3''.\n\nThere are several dozens of Ninja Houses in the city. Given a sequence of\nnumbers for each of these houses, you should produce a graph for each house.\n\n## Input\n\nThe first line of the input is a single integer _n_ , indicating the number of\nrecords of Ninja Houses I have visited. You can assume that _n_ is less than\n100. Each of the following _n_ records consists of numbers recorded on one\nexploration and a zero as a terminator. Each record consists of one or more\nlines whose lengths are less than 1000 characters. Each number is delimited by\na space or a newline. You can assume that the number of rooms for each Ninja\nHouse is less than 100, and the number of doors in each room is less than 40.\n\n## Output\n\nFor each Ninja House of _m_ rooms, the output should consist of _m_ lines. The\n_j_ -th line of each such _m_ lines should look as follows:\n\n    \n    \n    _i_ _r_ 1 _r_ 2  ... _r_ _k_ _i_\n    \n\nwhere _r_ 1, ... , _r ki_ should be rooms adjoining room _i_ , and _k i_\nshould be the number of doors in room _i_. Numbers should be separated by\nexactly one space character. The rooms should be numbered from 1 in visited\norder. _r_ 1, _r_ 2, ... , _r ki_ should be in ascending order. Note that the\nroom _i_ may be connected to another room through more than one door. In this\ncase, that room number should appear in _r_ 1, ... , _r ki_ as many times as\nit is connected by different doors.\n\n## Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    2\n    3 3 3 3 -3 3 2 -5 3 2 -5 -3 0\n    3 5 4 -2 4 -3 -2 -2 -1 0\n    \n\n## Output for the Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    1 2 4 6\n    2 1 3 8\n    3 2 4 7\n    4 1 3 5\n    5 4 6 7\n    6 1 5\n    7 3 5 8\n    8 2 7\n    1 2 3 4\n    2 1 3 3 4 4\n    3 1 2 2 4\n    4 1 2 2 3\n    \n\n",

        "prompt": "# Problem G: True Liars\n\nAfter having drifted about in a small boat for a couple of days, Akira Crusoe\nMaeda was finally cast ashore on a foggy island. Though he was exhausted and\ndespaired, he was still fortunate to remember a legend of the foggy island,\nwhich he had heard from patriarchs in his childhood. This must be the island\nin the legend.\n\nIn the legend, two tribes have inhabited the island, one is divine and the\nother is devilish; once members of the divine tribe bless you, your future is\nbright and promising, and your soul will eventually go to Heaven; in contrast,\nonce members of the devilish tribe curse you, your future is bleak and\nhopeless, and your soul will eventually fall down to Hell.\n\nIn order to prevent the worst-case scenario, Akira should distinguish the\ndevilish from the divine. But how? They looked exactly alike and he could not\ndistinguish one from the other solely by their appearances. He still had his\nlast hope, however. The members of the divine tribe are truth-tellers, that\nis, they always tell the truth and those of the devilish tribe are liars, that\nis, they always tell a lie.\n\nHe asked some of the whether or not some are divine. They knew one another\nvery much and always responded to him \"faithfully\" according to their\nindividual natures (i.e., they always tell the truth or always a lie). He did\nnot dare to ask any other forms of questions, since the legend says that a\ndevilish member would curse a person forever when he did not like the\nquestion. He had another piece of useful information: the legend tells the\npopulations of both tribes. These numbers in the legend are trustworthy since\neveryone living on this island is immortal and none have ever been born at\nleast these millennia.\n\nYou are a good computer programmer and so requested to help Akira by writing a\nprogram that classifies the inhabitants according to their answers to his\ninquiries.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input consists of multiple data sets, each in the following format:\n\n    \n    \n    _n_ _p_ 1 _p_ 2\n    _x_ 1 _y_ 1 _a_ 1\n    _x_ 2 _y_ 2 _a_ 2\n    ...\n    _x_ _i_ _y_ _i_ _a_ _i_\n    ...\n    _x_ _n_ _y_ _n_ _a_ _n_\n    \n\nThe first line has three non-negative integers _n_ , _p_ 1, and _p_ 2. _n_ is\nthe number of questions Akira asked. _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 are the populations of\nthe divine and devilish tribes, respectively, in the legend. Each of the\nfollowing _n_ lines has two integers _x i_, _y i_ and one word _a i_. _x i_\nand _y i_ are the identification numbers of inhabitants, each of which is\nbetween 1 and _p_ 1 \\+ _p_ 2, inclusive. _a i_ is either \"yes\", if the\ninhabitant _x i_ said that the inhabitant _y i_ was a member of the divine\ntribe, or \"no\", otherwise. Note that _x i_ and _y i_ can be the same number\nsince \"are you a member of the divine tribe?\" is a valid question. Note also\nthat two lines may have the same _x_ 's and _y_ 's since Akira was very upset\nand might have asked the same question to the same one more than once.\n\nYou may assume that _n_ is less than 1000 and that _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 are less\nthan 300. A line with three zeros, i.e., \"0 0 0\", represents the end of the\ninput. You can assume that each data set is consistent and no contradictory\nanswers are included.\n\n## Output\n\nFor each data set, if it includes sufficient information to classify all the\ninhabitants, print the identification numbers of all the divine ones in\nascending order, one in a line.

No other characters appear in a program.\n\nA declaration declares an array and specifies its length. Valid indices of an\narray of length _n_ are integers between 0 and _n_ \\- 1, inclusive. Note that\nthe array names are case sensitive, i.e. array a and array A are different\narrays. The initial value of each element in the declared array is undefined.\n\nFor example, array a of length 10 and array b of length 5 are declared\nrespectively as follows.\n\n    \n    \n    a[10]\n    b[5]\n    \n\nAn expression evaluates to a non-negative integer.

        "prompt": "# Problem A: Cubist Artwork\n\n_International Center for Picassonian Cubism_ is a Spanish national museum of\ncubist artworks, dedicated to Pablo Picasso. The center held a competition for\nan artwork that will be displayed in front of the facade of the museum\nbuilding. The artwork is a collection of cubes that are piled up on the ground\nand is intended to amuse visitors, who will be curious how the shape of the\ncollection of cubes changes when it is seen from the front and the sides.\n\nThe artwork is a collection of cubes with edges of one foot long and is built\non a flat ground that is divided into a grid of one foot by one foot squares.\nDue to some technical reasons, cubes of the artwork must be either put on the\nground, fitting into a unit square in the grid, or put on another cube in the\nway that the bottom face of the upper cube exactly meets the top face of the\nlower cube. No other way of putting cubes is possible.\n\nYou are a member of the judging committee responsible for selecting one out of\na plenty of artwork proposals submitted to the competition. The decision is\nmade primarily based on artistic quality but the cost for installing the\nartwork is another important factor. Your task is to investigate the\ninstallation cost for each proposal. The cost is proportional to the number of\ncubes, so you have to figure out the minimum number of cubes needed for\ninstallation.\n\nEach design proposal of an artwork consists of the front view and the side\nview (the view seen from the right-hand side), as shown in Figure 1.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE1_cubistArtwork1)  \n\nFigure 1: An example of an artwork proposal\n\nThe front view (resp., the side view) indicates the maximum heights of piles\nof cubes for each column line (resp., row line) of the grid.\n\nThere are several ways to install this proposal of artwork, such as the\nfollowing figures.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE1_cubistArtwork2)  \n\nIn these figures, the dotted lines on the ground indicate the grid lines. The\nleft figure makes use of 16 cubes, which is not optimal. That is, the artwork\ncan be installed with a fewer number of cubes. Actually, the right one is\noptimal and only uses 13 cubes. Note that, a single pile of height three in\nthe right figure plays the roles of two such piles in the left one.\n\nNotice that swapping columns of cubes does not change the side view.\nSimilarly, swapping rows does not change the front view. Thus, such swaps do\nnot change the costs of building the artworks.\n\nFor example, consider the artwork proposal given in Figure 2.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE1_cubistArtwork3)  \n\nFigure 2: Another example of artwork proposal\n\nAn optimal installation of this proposal of artwork can be achieved with 13\ncubes, as shown in the following figure, which can be obtained by exchanging\nthe rightmost two columns of the optimal installation of the artwork of Figure\n1.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE1_cubistArtwork4)  \n\n## Input\n\nThe input is a sequence of datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a\nline containing two zeros separated by a space. Each dataset is formatted as\nfollows.\n\n_w d_  \n_h_ 1 _h_ 2 ... _h w_  \n_h'_ 1 _h'_ 2 ... _h' d_  \n\nThe integers _w_ and _d_ separated by a space are the numbers of columns and\nrows of the grid, respectively. You may assume 1 \u2264 _w_ \u2264 10 and 1 \u2264 _d_ \u2264 10\\.\nThe integers separated by a space in the second and third lines specify the\nshape of the artwork.

        "prompt": "# Problem B: Repeated Substitution with Sed\n\nDo you know \"sed,\" a tool provided with Unix? Its most popular use is to\nsubstitute every occurrence of a string  contained in the input string\n(actually each input line) with another string _\u03b2_. More precisely, it\nproceeds as follows.\n\n  1. Within the input string, every non-overlapping (but possibly adjacent) occurrences of _\u03b1_ are marked. If there is more than one possibility for non-overlapping matching, the leftmost one is chosen.\n  2. Each of the marked occurrences is substituted with _\u03b2_ to obtain the output string; other parts of the input string remain intact.\n\nFor example, when _\u03b1_ is \"aa\" and _\u03b2_ is \"bca\", an input string \"aaxaaa\" will\nproduce \"bcaxbcaa\", but not \"aaxbcaa\" nor \"bcaxabca\". Further application of\nthe same substitution to the string \"bcaxbcaa\" will result in \"bcaxbcbca\", but\nthis is another substitution, which is counted as the second one.\n\nIn this problem, a set of substitution pairs (_\u03b1 i_, _\u03b2 i_) (_i_ = 1, 2, ... ,\n_n_), an initial string _\u03b3_ , and a final string _\u03b4_ are given, and you must\ninvestigate how to produce _\u03b4_ from _\u03b3_ with a minimum number of\nsubstitutions. A single substitution (_\u03b1 i_, _\u03b2 i_) here means simultaneously\nsubstituting all the non-overlapping occurrences of _\u03b1 i_, in the sense\ndescribed above, with _\u03b2 i_.\n\nYou may use a specific substitution (_\u03b1 i_, _\u03b2 i_ ) multiple times, including\nzero times.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input consists of multiple datasets, each in the following format.\n\n_n_  \n_\u03b1_ 1 _\u03b2_ 1  \n_\u03b1_ 2 _\u03b2_ 2  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n_\u03b1_ _n_ _\u03b2_ _n_  \n_\u03b3_ _\u03b4_\n\n_n_ is a positive integer indicating the number of pairs. _\u03b1 i_ and _\u03b2 i_ are separated by a single space. You may assume that 1 \u2264 |_\u03b1 i_| < |_\u03b2 i_| \u2264 10 for any _i_ (|_s_ | means the length of the string _s_), _\u03b1 i_ \u2260 _\u03b1 j_ for any _i_ \u2260 _j_ , _n_ \u2264 10 and 1 \u2264 |_\u03b3_ | < |_\u03b4_ | \u2264 10\\.

The vehicle can carry at most three balloons at a time,\nbut its speed changes according to the number of the carrying balloons. When\nthe vehicle carries _k_ balloons (_k_ = 0, 1, 2, 3), it takes _k_ +1 units of\ntime to move one unit distance.

The logbook also records\nher visits at the altar.\n\nThe altar attracts programmers from all over the world because one visitor is\nchosen every year and endowed with a gift of miracle programming power by the\ngoddess. The endowed programmer is chosen from those programmers who spent the\nlongest time at the altar during the goddess's presence. There have been\nenthusiastic visitors who spent very long time at the altar but failed to\nreceive the gift because the goddess was absent during their visits.\n\nNow, your mission is to write a program that finds how long the programmer to\nbe endowed stayed at the altar during the goddess's presence.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input is a sequence of datasets.

This line is followed by _n_ lines\nof space-separated data, where _M_ i _/D_ i identifies the month and the day\nof the visit, _h_ i:_m_ i represents the time of either the entrance to or\nexit from the altar, _e_ i is either I for entrance, or O for exit, and _p_ i\nidentifies the visitor.\n\nAll the lines in the logbook are formatted in a fixed-column format. Both the\nmonth and the day in the month are represented by two digits. Therefore April\n1 is represented by 04/01 and not by 4/1. The time is described in the 24-hour\nsystem, taking two digits for the hour, followed by a colon and two digits for\nminutes, 09:13 for instance and not like 9:13. A programmer is identified by\nan ID, a unique number using three digits. The same format is used to indicate\nentrance and exit of the goddess, whose ID is 000.\n\nAll the lines in the logbook are sorted in ascending order with respect to\ndate and time. Because the altar is closed at midnight, the altar is emptied\nat 00:00. You may assume that each time in the input is between 00:01 and\n23:59, inclusive.\n\nA programmer may leave the altar just after entering it. In this case, the\nentrance and exit time are the same and the length of such a visit is\nconsidered 0 minute. You may assume for such entrance and exit records, the\nline that corresponds to the entrance appears earlier in the input than the\nline that corresponds to the exit.

        "prompt": "# Problem H: ASCII Expression\n\nMathematical expressions appearing in old papers and old technical articles\nare printed with typewriter in several lines, where a fixed-width or\nmonospaced font is required to print characters (digits, symbols and spaces).\nLet us consider the following mathematical expression.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_1322_1)\n\nIt is printed in the following four lines:\n\n    \n    \n            4   2\n    ( 1 - ---- )  * - 5 + 6\n            2\n           3\n    \n\nwhere \"\\- 5\" indicates unary minus followed by 5. We call such an expression\nof lines \"ASCII expression\".\n\nFor helping those who want to evaluate ASCII expressions obtained through\noptical character recognition (OCR) from old papers, your job is to write a\nprogram that recognizes the structure of ASCII expressions and computes their\nvalues.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, you may assume that ASCII expressions are\nconstructed by the following rules. Its syntax is shown in Table H.1.\n\n(1) | Terminal symbols are '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '+', '-', '*', '(', ')', and ' '.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Nonterminal symbols are _expr_ , _term_ , _factor_ , _powexpr_ , _primary_ , _fraction_ and _digit_. The start symbol is _expr_.  \n(3) | A \"cell\" is a rectangular region of characters that corresponds to a terminal or nonterminal symbol (Figure H.1). In the cell, there are no redundant rows and columns that consist only of space characters. A cell corresponding to a terminal symbol consists of a single character. A cell corresponding to a nonterminal symbol contains cell(s) corresponding to its descendant(s) but never partially overlaps others.  \n(4) | Each cell has a base-line, a top-line, and a bottom-line. The base-lines of child cells of the right-hand side of rules I, II, III, and V should be aligned. Their vertical position defines the base-line position of their left-hand side cell.  \nTable H.1: Rules for constructing ASCII expressions (similar to Backus-Naur\nForm) The box indicates the cell of the terminal or nonterminal symbol that\ncorresponds to a rectan- gular region of characters. Note that each\nsyntactically-needed space character is explicitly indicated by the period\ncharacter denoted by, here.  \n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_1322_2)  \n(5) | _powexpr_ consists of a _primary_ and an optional _digit_. The _digit_ is placed one line above the base-line of the _primary cell. They are horizontally adjacent to each other. The base-line of a _powexpr_ is that of the _primary_.  \n(6) | _fraction_ is indicated by three or more consecutive hyphens called \"vinculum\". Its dividend expr is placed just above the vinculum, and its divisor expr is placed just beneath it. The number of the hyphens of the vinculum, denoted by _w h_, is equal to 2 + max(_w 1_, _w 2_), where _w 1_ and _w 2_ indicate the width of the cell of the dividend and that of the divisor, respectively. These cells are centered, where there are \u2308(_w h_\u2212 _w k_)/2\u2309 space characters to the left and \u230a(_w h_\u2212 _w k_)/2\u230b space characters to the right, (_k_ = 1, 2). The base-line of a fraction is at the position of the vinculum. | (7) | _digit_ consists of one character.  \n  \n\nFor example, the negative\nfraction![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_1322_3) is\nrepresented in three lines:\n\n    \n    \n       3\n    - ---\n       4\n\nwhere the left-most hyphen means a unary minus operator. One space character\nis required between the unary minus and the vinculum of the fraction.\n\nThe fraction ![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_1322_4)\nis represented in four lines:\n\n    \n    \n     3 + 4 * - 2\n    -------------\n              2\n       - 1 - 2\n    \n\nwhere the widths of the cells of the dividend and divisor are 11 and 8\nrespectively. Hence the number of hyphens of the vinculum is 2 + max(11, 8) =\n13. The divisor is centered by \u2308(13\u22128)/2\u2309 = 3 space characters (hyphens) to\nthe left and \u230a(13\u22128)/2\u230b = 2 to the right.\n\nThe _powexpr_ (42)3 is represented in two lines:\n\n    \n    \n       2  3\n    ( 4  )\n    \n\nwhere the cell for 2 is placed one line above the base-line of the cell for 4,\nand the cell for 3 is placed one line above the base-line of the cell for a\nprimary (42).\n\n## Input\n\nThe input consists of multiple datasets, followed by a line containing a zero.\nEach dataset has the following format.\n\n    \n    \n    n\n    str1\n    str2\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    strn\n    \n\n_n_ is a positive integer, which indicates the number of the following lines\nwith the same length that represent the cell of an ASCII expression. _str k_\nis the _k_ -th line of the cell where each space character is replaced with a\nperiod.\n\nYou may assume that _n_ \u2264 20 and that the length of the lines is no more than\n80.\n\n## Output\n\nFor each dataset, one line containing a non-negative integer less than 2011\nshould be output. The integer indicates the value of the ASCII expression in\nmodular arithmetic under modulo 2011. The output should not contain any other\ncharacters.\n\nThere is no _fraction_ with the divisor that is equal to zero or a multiple of\n2011.\n\nNote that powexpr _x 0_ is defined as 1, and _x y_ (y is a positive integer)\nis defined as the product _x \u00d7x\u00d7_...\u00d7 _x_ where the number of _x_ 's is equal\nto _y_.\n\nA fraction![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_1322_5)is\ncomputed as the multiplication of _x_ and the inverse of _y_ , i.e., _x_ \u00d7\ninv(_y_), under _y_ modulo 2011. The inverse of _y_ (1 \u2264 y < 2011) is uniquely\ndefined as the integer _z_ (1 \u2264 z < 2011) that satisfies _z_ \u00d7 _y_ \u2261 1 (mod\n2011), since 2011 is a prime number.\n\n## Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    4\n    ........4...2..........\n    (.1.-.----.)..*.-.5.+.6\n    ........2..............\n    .......3...............\n    3\n    ...3.\n    -.---\n    ...4.\n    4\n    .3.+.4.*.-.2.\n    -------------\n    ..........2..\n    ...-.1.-.2...\n    2\n    ...2..3\n    (.4..).\n    1\n    2.+.3.*.5.-.7.+.9\n    1\n    (.2.+.3.).*.(.5.-.7.).+.9\n    3\n    .2....3.\n    4..+.---\n    ......5.\n    3\n    .2......-.-.3.\n    4..-.-.-------\n    ..........5...\n    9\n    ............1............\n    -------------------------\n    ..............1..........\n    .1.+.-------------------.\n    ................1........\n    ......1.+.-------------..\n    ..................1......\n    ...........1.+.-------...\n    ................1.+.2....\n    15\n    .................2......\n    ................---.....\n    .......2.........5....3.\n    .(.---------.+.-----.)..\n    .....7...........3......\n    ....---.+.1.............\n    .....4..................\n    ------------------------\n    .......2................\n    ......---...............\n    .......5.......2....2...\n    ...(.-----.+.-----.)....\n    .......3.......3........\n    ..............---.......\n    ...............4........\n    2\n    .0....2....\n    3..+.4..*.5\n    20\n    ............2............................2......................................\n    ...........3............................3.......................................\n    ..........----.........................----.....................................\n    ............4............................4......................................\n    .....2.+.------.+.1...............2.+.------.+.1................................\n    ............2............................2......................................\n    ...........2............................2........................2..............\n    ..........----.........................----.....................3...............\n    ............2............................2.....................----.............\n    ...........3............................3........................4..............\n    (.(.----------------.+.2.+.3.).*.----------------.+.2.).*.2.+.------.+.1.+.2.*.5\n    ............2............................2.......................2..............\n    ...........5............................5.......................2...............\n    ..........----.........................----....................----.............\n    ............6............................6.......................2..............\n    .........------.......................------....................3...............\n    ............3............................3......................................\n    ..........----.........................----.....................................\n    ............2............................2......................................\n    ...........7............................7.......................................\n    0\n    \n\n## Output for the Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    501\n    502\n    1\n    74\n    19\n    2010\n    821\n    821\n    1646\n    148\n    81\n    1933\n    \n\n",

        "prompt": "# Problem B: The Last Ant\n\nA straight tunnel without branches is crowded with busy ants coming and going.\nSome ants walk left to right and others right to left. All ants walk at a\nconstant speed of 1 cm/s. When two ants meet, they try to pass each other.\nHowever, some sections of the tunnel are narrow and two ants cannot pass each\nother. When two ants meet at a narrow section, they turn around and start\nwalking in the opposite directions. When an ant reaches either end of the\ntunnel, it leaves the tunnel.\n\nThe tunnel has an integer length in centimeters. Every narrow section of the\ntunnel is integer centimeters distant from the both ends. Except for these\nsections, the tunnel is wide enough for ants to pass each other. All ants\nstart walking at distinct narrow sections. No ants will newly enter the\ntunnel. Consequently, all the ants in the tunnel will eventually leave it.\nYour task is to write a program that tells which is the last ant to leave the\ntunnel and when it will.\n\nFigure B.1 shows the movements of the ants during the first two seconds in a\ntunnel 6 centimeters long. Initially, three ants, numbered 1, 2, and 3, start\nwalking at narrow sections, 1, 2, and 5 centimeters distant from the left end,\nrespectively. After 0.5 seconds, the ants 1 and 2 meet at a wide section, and\nthey pass each other. Two seconds after the start, the ants 1 and 3 meet at a\nnarrow section, and they turn around.\n\nFigure B.1 corresponds to the first dataset of the sample input.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_theLastAnt1)  \nFigure B.1.

The following n lines describe the\ninitial states of ants. Each of the lines has two items, di and pi, separated\nby a space. Ants are given numbers 1 through n. The ant numbered i has the\ninitial direction di and the initial position pi. The initial direction di (1\n\u2264 i \u2264 n) is **L** (to the left) or **R** (to the right). The initial position\npi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) is an integer specifying the distance from the left end of the\ntunnel in centimeters. Ants are listed in the left to right order, that is, 1\n\u2264 p1 < p2 < ... < pn \u2264 l \\- 1.\n\nThe last dataset is followed by a line containing two zeros separated by a\nspace.\n\n## Output\n\nFor each dataset, output how many seconds it will take before all the ants\nleave the tunnel, and which of the ants will be the last. The last ant is\nidentified by its number.

        "prompt": "# Problem F: Two-Wheel Buggy\n\nInternational Car Production Company (ICPC), one of the largest automobile\nmanufacturers in the world, is now developing a new vehicle called \"Two-Wheel\nBuggy\". As its name suggests, the vehicle has only two wheels. Quite simply,\n\"Two-Wheel Buggy\" is made up of two wheels (the left wheel and the right\nwheel) and a axle (a bar connecting two wheels). The figure below shows its\nbasic structure.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_buggy1)\n\nFigure 7: The basic structure of the buggy\n\nBefore making a prototype of this new vehicle, the company decided to run a\ncomputer simula- tion. The details of the simulation is as follows.\n\nIn the simulation, the buggy will move on the x-y plane. Let _D_ be the\ndistance from the center of the axle to the wheels. At the beginning of the\nsimulation, the center of the axle is at (0, 0), the left wheel is at (-_D_ ,\n0), and the right wheel is at (_D_ , 0). The radii of two wheels are 1.\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_buggy2)\n\nFigure 8: The initial position of the buggy\n\nThe movement of the buggy in the simulation is controlled by a sequence of\ninstructions. Each instruction consists of three numbers, _Lspeed_ , _Rspeed_\nand _time_. _Lspeed_ and _Rspeed_ indicate the rotation speed of the left and\nright wheels, respectively, expressed in degree par second. time indicates how\nmany seconds these two wheels keep their rotation speed. If a speed of a wheel\nis positive, it will rotate in the direction that causes the buggy to move\nforward. Conversely, if a speed is negative, it will rotate in the opposite\ndirection. For example, if we set _Lspeed_ as -360, the left wheel will rotate\n360-degree in one second in the direction that makes the buggy move backward.\nWe can set Lspeed and Rspeed differently, and this makes the buggy turn left\nor right. Note that we can also set one of them positive and the other\nnegative (in this case, the buggy will spin around).\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_buggy3)\n\nFigure 9: Examples\n\nYour job is to write a program that calculates the final position of the buggy\ngiven a instruction sequence. For simplicity, you can can assume that wheels\nhave no width, and that they would never slip.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input consists of several datasets. Each dataset is formatted as follows.\n\n_N D_  \n_Lspeed_ 1 _Rspeed_ 1 _time_ 1  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n_Lspeed i_ _Rspeed i_ _time i_  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n_Lspeed N_ _Rspeed N_ _time N_  \n\nThe first line of a dataset contains two positive integers, _N_ and _D_ (1 \u2264\n_N_ \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 _D_ \u2264 10). _N_ indicates the number of instructions in the\ndataset, and _D_ indicates the distance between the center of axle and the\nwheels. The following _N_ lines describe the instruction sequence. The _i_ -th\nline contains three integers, _Lspeed i_, i_, and _time i_ (-360 \u2264 _Lspeed i_,\n_Rspeed i_ \u2264 360, 1 \u2264 _time i_ ), describing the _i_ -th instruction to the\nbuggy. You can assume that the sum of timei is at most 500.\n\nThe end of input is indicated by a line containing two zeros. This line is not\npart of any dataset and hence should not be processed.\n\n## Output\n\nFor each dataset, output two lines indicating the final position of the center\nof the axle. The first line should contain the _x_ -coordinate, and the second\nline should contain the _y_ -coordinate. The absolute error should be less\nthan or equal to 10-3 . No extra character should appear in the output.\n\n## Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    1 1\n    180 90 2\n    1 1\n    180 180 20\n    2 10\n    360 -360 5\n    -90 360 8\n    3 2\n    100 60 9\n    -72 -72 10\n    -45 -225 5\n    0 0\n    \n\n## Output for the Sample Input\n\n    \n    \n    3.00000\n    3.00000\n    0.00000\n    62.83185\n    12.00000\n    0.00000\n    -2.44505\n    13.12132\n    \n\n",

There are two commands you can give to\nGururin: 'R' and 'L'. When 'R' is sent, Gururin rotates clockwise by 90\ndegrees. Otherwise, when 'L' is sent, Gururin rotates counterclockwise by 90\ndegrees.\n\nDuring the game, you noticed that Gururin obtains magical power by performing\nspecial commands. In short, Gururin obtains magical power every time when it\nperforms one round in the clockwise direction from north to north. In more\ndetail, the conditions under which magical power can be obtained is as\nfollows.\n\n  * At the beginning of the special commands, Gururin faces north.\n  * At the end of special commands, Gururin faces north.\n  * Except for the beginning and the end of special commands, Gururin does not face north.\n  * During the special commands, Gururin faces north, east, south, and west one or more times, respectively, after the command of 'R'.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Gururin faces north. For example, if the\nsequence of commands Gururin received in order is 'RRRR' or 'RRLRRLRR',\nGururin can obtain magical power. Otherwise, if the sequence of commands is\n'LLLL' or 'RLLR', Gururin cannot obtain magical power.\n\nYour task is to calculate how many times Gururin obtained magical power\nthroughout the game. In other words, given the sequence of the commands\nGururin received, calculate how many special commands exists in it.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input consists of a single test case in the format below.\n\n    \n    \n    $S$\n    \n\nThe first line consists of a string $S$, which represents the sequence of\ncommands Gururin received. $S$ consists of 'L' and 'R'.

If there is only one node without a parent, which is the root, finish the algorithm.

Suppose solve(p, t) is a\nfunction which checkes whether you can make t by selecting elements after p-th\nelement (inclusive). Then you can recursively call the following functions:\n\nsolve(0, M)  \nsolve(1, M-{sum created from elements before 1st element})  \nsolve(2, M-{sum created from elements before 2nd element})  \n...\n\nThe recursive function has two choices: you selected p-th element and not. So,\nyou can check solve(p+1, t-A[p]) and solve(p+1, t) in solve(p, t) to check the\nall combinations.\n\nFor example, the following figure shows that 8 can be made by A[0] + A[2].\n\n![](https://judgeapi.u-aizu.ac.jp/resources/images/IMAGE2_ALDS1_5_A)\n\n",

The lengths (in centimeters) of these are l_1, l_2, ...,\nl_N, respectively.\n\nYour objective is to use some of these bamboos (possibly all) to obtain three\nbamboos of length A, B, C. For that, you can use the following three kinds of\nmagics any number:\n\n  * Extension Magic: Consumes 1 _MP_ (magic point). Choose one bamboo and increase its length by 1.\n  * Shortening Magic: Consumes 1 MP. Choose one bamboo of length at least 2 and decrease its length by 1.\n  * Composition Magic: Consumes 10 MP. Choose two bamboos and combine them into one bamboo. The length of this new bamboo is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two bamboos combined. (Afterwards, further magics can be used on this bamboo.)\n\nAt least how much MP is needed to achieve the objective?\n\n### Constraints\n\n  * 3 \\leq N \\leq 8\n  * 1 \\leq C < B < A \\leq 1000\n  * 1 \\leq l_i \\leq 1000\n  * All values in input are integers.\n\n* * *\n\n### Input\n\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\n    \n    \n    N A B C\n    l_1\n    l_2\n    :\n    l_N\n    \n\n### Output\n\nPrint the minimum amount of MP needed to achieve the objective.\n\n* * *\n\n### Sample Input 1\n\n    \n    \n    5 100 90 80\n    98\n    40\n    30\n    21\n    80\n    \n\n### Sample Output 1\n\n    \n    \n    23\n    \n\nWe are obtaining three bamboos of lengths 100, 90, 80 from five bamboos 98,\n40, 30, 21, 80. We already have a bamboo of length 80, and we can obtain\nbamboos of lengths 100, 90 by using the magics as follows at the total cost of\n23 MP, which is optimal.\n\n  1. Use Extension Magic twice on the bamboo of length 98 to obtain a bamboo of length 100. (MP consumed: 2)\n  2. Use Composition Magic on the bamboos of lengths 40, 30 to obtain a bamboo of length 70. (MP consumed: 10)\n  3. Use Shortening Magic once on the bamboo of length 21 to obtain a bamboo of length 20. (MP consumed: 1)\n  4.

Ringo performs the following operation:\n\n  * Randomly choose a point from the interior of a circle of radius R centered at the origin, and put Snuke there. Snuke will move to the hole with the smallest Euclidean distance from the point, and fall into that hole. If there are multiple such holes, the hole with the smallest index will be chosen.\n\nFor every i (1 \\leq i \\leq N), find the probability that Snuke falls into the\ni-th hole.\n\nHere, the operation of randomly choosing a point from the interior of a circle\nof radius R is defined as follows:\n\n  * Pick two real numbers x and y independently according to uniform distribution on [-R,R].\n  * If x^2+y^2\\leq R^2, the point (x,y) is chosen. Otherwise, repeat picking the real numbers x,y until the condition is met.\n\n### Constraints\n\n  * 2 \\leq N \\leq 100\n  * |x_i|,|y_i| \\leq 10^6(1\\leq i\\leq N)\n  * All given points are pairwise distinct.\n  * All input values are integers.\n\n* * *\n\n### Input\n\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\n    \n    \n    N\n    x_1 y_1\n    :\n    x_N y_N\n    \n\n### Output\n\nPrint N real numbers.
