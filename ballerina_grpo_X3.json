        "prompt": "Title: String Manipulation 1.0\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne popular website developed an unusual username editing procedure. One can change the username only by deleting some characters from it: to change the current name *s*, a user can pick number *p* and character *c* and delete the *p*-th occurrence of character *c* from the name. After the user changed his name, he can't undo the change.\n\nFor example, one can change name \"arca\" by removing the second occurrence of character \"a\" to get \"arc\". \n\nPolycarpus learned that some user initially registered under nickname *t*, where *t* is a concatenation of *k* copies of string *s*. Also, Polycarpus knows the sequence of this user's name changes. Help Polycarpus figure out the user's final name.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=2000). The second line contains a non-empty string *s*, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, at most 100 characters long. The third line contains an integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=20000) \u2014 the number of username changes. Each of the next *n* lines contains the actual changes, one per line. The changes are written as \"*p**i* *c**i*\" (without the quotes), where *p**i* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=200000) is the number of occurrences of letter *c**i*, *c**i* is a lowercase Latin letter. It is guaranteed that the operations are correct, that is, the letter to be deleted always exists, and after all operations not all letters are deleted from the name. The letters' occurrences are numbered starting from 1.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single string \u2014 the user's final name after all changes are applied to it.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\nbac\\n3\\n2 a\\n1 b\\n2 c\\n', '1\\nabacaba\\n4\\n1 a\\n1 a\\n1 c\\n2 b\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['acb\\n', 'baa\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's consider the first sample. Initially we have name \"bacbac\"; the first operation transforms it into \"bacbc\", the second one \u2014 to \"acbc\", and finally, the third one transforms it into \"acb\".",

        "prompt": "Title: Food on the Plane\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA new airplane SuperPuperJet has an infinite number of rows, numbered with positive integers starting with 1 from cockpit to tail. There are six seats in each row, denoted with letters from 'a' to 'f'. Seats 'a', 'b' and 'c' are located to the left of an aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit), while seats 'd', 'e' and 'f' are located to the right. Seats 'a' and 'f' are located near the windows, while seats 'c' and 'd' are located near the aisle. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's lunch time and two flight attendants have just started to serve food. They move from the first rows to the tail, always maintaining a distance of two rows from each other because of the food trolley. Thus, at the beginning the first attendant serves row 1 while the second attendant serves row 3. When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row 2 while the second attendant serves row 4. Then they move three rows forward and the first attendant serves row 5 while the second attendant serves row 7. Then they move one row forward again and so on.\n\nFlight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly 1 second to serve one passenger and 1 second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. Thus, the first passenger to receive food in each row is located in seat 'f', and the last one\u00a0\u2014 in seat 'c'. Assume that all seats are occupied.\n\nVasya has seat *s* in row *n* and wants to know how many seconds will pass before he gets his lunch.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line of input contains a description of Vasya's seat in the format *ns*, where *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1018) is the index of the row and *s* is the seat in this row, denoted as letter from 'a' to 'f'. The index of the row and the seat are not separated by a space.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1f\\n', '2d\\n', '4a\\n', '5e\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '10\\n', '11\\n', '18\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, the first flight attendant serves Vasya first, so Vasya gets his lunch after 1 second.\n\nIn the second sample, the flight attendants will spend 6 seconds to serve everyone in the rows 1 and 3, then they will move one row forward in 1 second. As they first serve seats located to the right of the aisle in order from window to aisle, Vasya has to wait 3 more seconds. The total is 6\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u200910.",

You probably remember that it goes down to Fibonacci numbers. We will talk about some other problem below, there you also are going to deal with tiling a rectangular field with dominoes.\n\nYou are given a 4<=\u00d7<=*n* rectangular field, that is the field that contains four lines and *n* columns. You have to find for it any tiling by 1<=\u00d7<=2 dominoes such that each of the *n*<=-<=1 potential vertical cuts along the grid lines intersects at least one domino, splitting it in two. No two dominoes in the sought tiling should overlap, each square of the field should be covered by exactly one domino. It is allowed to rotate the dominoes, that is, you can use 2<=\u00d7<=1 as well as 1<=\u00d7<=2 dominoes.\n\nWrite a program that finds an arbitrary sought tiling.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input contains one positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of the field's columns.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there's no solution, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print four lines containing *n* characters each \u2014 that's the description of tiling, where each vertical cut intersects at least one domino. You should print the tiling, having painted the field in no more than 26 colors. Each domino should be painted a color. Different dominoes can be painted the same color, but dominoes of the same color should not be side-neighbouring. To indicate colors you should use lowercase Latin letters.

As everybody in the evil land knows, Dr. Evil likes bipartite graphs, especially trees.\n\nA tree is a connected acyclic graph. A bipartite graph is a graph, whose vertices can be partitioned into 2 sets in such a way, that for each edge (*u*,<=*v*) that belongs to the graph, *u* and *v* belong to different sets. You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.\n\nDr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of *n* nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself. Graph doesn't contain multiple edges when for each pair of nodes there is no more than one edge between them.

Fangy also has a box with a square base 2*n*<=\u00d7<=2*n*, divided into blocks 1<=\u00d7<=1 in size. In a box the cookies should not overlap, and they should not be turned over or rotated. See cookies of sizes 2 and 4 respectively on the figure: \n\nTo stack the cookies the little walrus uses the following algorithm. He takes out of the repository the largest cookie which can fit in some place in the box and puts it there. Everything could be perfect but alas, in the repository the little walrus has infinitely many cookies of size 2 and larger, and there are no cookies of size 1, therefore, empty cells will remain in the box.

        "prompt": "Title: Petya and Catacombs\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nA very brave explorer Petya once decided to explore Paris catacombs. Since Petya is not really experienced, his exploration is just walking through the catacombs.\n\nCatacombs consist of several rooms and bidirectional passages between some pairs of them. Some passages can connect a room to itself and since the passages are built on different depths they do not intersect each other. Every minute Petya arbitrary chooses a passage from the room he is currently in and then reaches the room on the other end of the passage in exactly one minute. When he enters a room at minute *i*, he makes a note in his logbook with number *t**i*: \n -  If Petya has visited this room before, he writes down the minute he was in this room last time; -  Otherwise, Petya writes down an arbitrary non-negative integer strictly less than current minute *i*. \nInitially, Petya was in one of the rooms at minute 0, he didn't write down number *t*0.\n\nAt some point during his wandering Petya got tired, threw out his logbook and went home. Vasya found his logbook and now he is curious: what is the minimum possible number of rooms in Paris catacombs according to Petya's logbook?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105) \u2014 then number of notes in Petya's logbook.\n\nThe second line contains *n* non-negative integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n* (0<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=&lt;<=*i*) \u2014 notes in the logbook.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the only line print a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible number of rooms in Paris catacombs.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n0 0\\n', '5\\n0 1 0 1 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, sequence of rooms Petya visited could be, for example 1\u2009\u2192\u20091\u2009\u2192\u20092, 1\u2009\u2192\u20092\u2009\u2192\u20091 or 1\u2009\u2192\u20092\u2009\u2192\u20093. The minimum possible number of rooms is 2.\n\nIn the second sample, the sequence could be 1\u2009\u2192\u20092\u2009\u2192\u20093\u2009\u2192\u20091\u2009\u2192\u20092\u2009\u2192\u20091.",

        "prompt": "Title: Find The Bone\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nZane the wizard is going to perform a magic show shuffling the cups.\n\nThere are *n* cups, numbered from 1 to *n*, placed along the *x*-axis on a table that has *m* holes on it. More precisely, cup *i* is on the table at the position *x*<==<=*i*.\n\nThe problematic bone is initially at the position *x*<==<=1. Zane will confuse the audience by swapping the cups *k* times, the *i*-th time of which involves the cups at the positions *x*<==<=*u**i* and *x*<==<=*v**i*. If the bone happens to be at the position where there is a hole at any time, it will fall into the hole onto the ground and will not be affected by future swapping operations.\n\nDo not forget that Zane is a wizard. When he swaps the cups, he does not move them ordinarily. Instead, he teleports the cups (along with the bone, if it is inside) to the intended positions. Therefore, for example, when he swaps the cup at *x*<==<=4 and the one at *x*<==<=6, they will not be at the position *x*<==<=5 at any moment during the operation.\n\nZane\u2019s puppy, Inzane, is in trouble. Zane is away on his vacation, and Inzane cannot find his beloved bone, as it would be too exhausting to try opening all the cups. Inzane knows that the Codeforces community has successfully helped Zane, so he wants to see if it could help him solve his problem too. Help Inzane determine the final position of the bone.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106, 1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cups, the number of holes on the table, and the number of swapping operations, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *m* distinct integers *h*1,<=*h*2,<=...,<=*h**m* (1<=\u2264<=*h**i*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the positions along the *x*-axis where there is a hole on the table.\n\nEach of the next *k* lines contains two integers *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*)\u00a0\u2014 the positions of the cups to be swapped.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the final position along the *x*-axis of the bone.\n\nDemo Input:\n['7 3 4\\n3 4 6\\n1 2\\n2 5\\n5 7\\n7 1\\n', '5 1 2\\n2\\n1 2\\n2 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1', '2']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, after the operations, the bone becomes at *x*\u2009=\u20092, *x*\u2009=\u20095, *x*\u2009=\u20097, and *x*\u2009=\u20091, respectively.\n\nIn the second sample, after the first operation, the bone becomes at *x*\u2009=\u20092, and falls into the hole onto the ground.",

        "prompt": "Title: Phone Numbers\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVasya has several phone books, in which he recorded the telephone numbers of his friends. Each of his friends can have one or several phone numbers.\n\nVasya decided to organize information about the phone numbers of friends. You will be given *n* strings \u2014 all entries from Vasya's phone books. Each entry starts with a friend's name. Then follows the number of phone numbers in the current entry, and then the phone numbers themselves. It is possible that several identical phones are recorded in the same record.\n\nVasya also believes that if the phone number *a* is a suffix of the phone number *b* (that is, the number *b* ends up with *a*), and both numbers are written by Vasya as the phone numbers of the same person, then *a* is recorded without the city code and it should not be taken into account.\n\nThe task is to print organized information about the phone numbers of Vasya's friends. It is possible that two different people have the same number. If one person has two numbers *x* and *y*, and *x* is a suffix of *y* (that is, *y* ends in *x*), then you shouldn't print number *x*. If the number of a friend in the Vasya's phone books is recorded several times in the same format, it is necessary to take it into account exactly once.\n\nRead the examples to understand statement and format of the output better.\n\nInput Specification:\nFirst line contains the integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=20)\u00a0\u2014 number of entries in Vasya's phone books. \n\nThe following *n* lines are followed by descriptions of the records in the format described in statement. Names of Vasya's friends are non-empty strings whose length does not exceed 10. They consists only of lowercase English letters. Number of phone numbers in one entry is not less than 1 is not more than 10. The telephone numbers consist of digits only. If you represent a phone number as a string, then its length will be in range from 1 to 10. Phone numbers can contain leading zeros.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint out the ordered information about the phone numbers of Vasya's friends.

He thinks that any decent eight point set must consist of all pairwise intersections of three distinct integer vertical straight lines and three distinct integer horizontal straight lines, except for the average of these nine points. In other words, there must be three integers *x*1,<=*x*2,<=*x*3 and three more integers *y*1,<=*y*2,<=*y*3, such that *x*1<=&lt;<=*x*2<=&lt;<=*x*3, *y*1<=&lt;<=*y*2<=&lt;<=*y*3 and the eight point set consists of all points (*x**i*,<=*y**j*) (1<=\u2264<=*i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=3), except for point (*x*2,<=*y*2).\n\nYou have a set of eight points.

Father bear can climb into the largest car and he likes it. Also, mother bear can climb into the middle car and she likes it. Moreover, son bear can climb into the smallest car and he likes it. It's known that the largest car is strictly larger than the middle car, and the middle car is strictly larger than the smallest car. \n\nMasha came to test these cars. She could climb into all cars, but she liked only the smallest car. \n\nIt's known that a character with size *a* can climb into some car with size *b* if and only if *a*<=\u2264<=*b*, he or she likes it if and only if he can climb into this car and 2*a*<=\u2265<=*b*.\n\nYou are given sizes of bears and Masha.

        "prompt": "Title: Code Parsing\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLittle Vitaly loves different algorithms. Today he has invented a new algorithm just for you. Vitaly's algorithm works with string *s*, consisting of characters \"x\" and \"y\", and uses two following operations at runtime:\n 1.  Find two consecutive characters in the string, such that the first of them equals \"y\", and the second one equals \"x\" and swap them. If there are several suitable pairs of characters, we choose the pair of characters that is located closer to the beginning of the string. 1.  Find in the string two consecutive characters, such that the first of them equals \"x\" and the second one equals \"y\". Remove these characters from the string. If there are several suitable pairs of characters, we choose the pair of characters that is located closer to the beginning of the string. \nThe input for the new algorithm is string *s*, and the algorithm works as follows:\n 1.  If you can apply at least one of the described operations to the string, go to step 2 of the algorithm. Otherwise, stop executing the algorithm and print the current string. 1.  If you can apply operation 1, then apply it. Otherwise, apply operation 2. After you apply the operation, go to step 1 of the algorithm. \nNow Vitaly wonders, what is going to be printed as the result of the algorithm's work, if the input receives string *s*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a non-empty string *s*. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the string only consists of characters \"x\" and \"y\". It is guaranteed that the string consists of at most 106 characters. It is guaranteed that as the result of the algorithm's execution won't be an empty string.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the only line print the string that is printed as the result of the algorithm's work, if the input of the algorithm input receives string *s*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['x\\n', 'yxyxy\\n', 'xxxxxy\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['x\\n', 'y\\n', 'xxxx\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test the algorithm will end after the first step of the algorithm, as it is impossible to apply any operation. Thus, the string won't change.\n\nIn the second test the transformation will be like this:\n 1.  string \"yxyxy\" transforms into string \"xyyxy\"; 1.  string \"xyyxy\" transforms into string \"xyxyy\"; 1.  string \"xyxyy\" transforms into string \"xxyyy\"; 1.  string \"xxyyy\" transforms into string \"xyy\"; 1.  string \"xyy\" transforms into string \"y\". \nAs a result, we've got string \"y\". \n\nIn the third test case only one transformation will take place: string \"xxxxxy\" transforms into string \"xxxx\". Thus, the answer will be string \"xxxx\".",

Today you and your friends went for class, and found out that some of the seats were occupied.\n\nThe classroom contains $n$ rows of seats and there are $m$ seats in each row. Then the classroom can be represented as an $n \\times m$ matrix. The character '.' represents an empty seat, while '*' means that the seat is occupied.

Squares are numbered 1, 2, 3 and so on. Vika decided that she will start painting squares one by one from left to right, starting from the square number 1 and some arbitrary color. If the square was painted in color *x*, then the next square will be painted in color *x*<=+<=1. In case of *x*<==<=*n*, next square is painted in color 1. If there is no more paint of the color Vika wants to use now, then she stops.\n\nSquare is always painted in only one color, and it takes exactly 1 liter of paint.

Print in the order of decreasing of the coins' denominations.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first and only line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=106) which represents the denomination of the most expensive coin.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the denominations of all the coins in the order of decreasing. The number of coins must be the largest possible (with the given denomination *n* of the most expensive coin). Also, the denomination of every coin must be divisible by the denomination of any cheaper coin. Naturally, the denominations of all the coins should be different. If there are several solutins to that problem, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['10\\n', '4\\n', '3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['10 5 1\\n', '4 2 1\\n', '3 1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Hongcow Solves A Puzzle\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nHongcow likes solving puzzles.\n\nOne day, Hongcow finds two identical puzzle pieces, with the instructions \"make a rectangle\" next to them. The pieces can be described by an *n* by *m* grid of characters, where the character 'X' denotes a part of the puzzle and '.' denotes an empty part of the grid. It is guaranteed that the puzzle pieces are one 4-connected piece. See the input format and samples for the exact details on how a jigsaw piece will be specified.\n\nThe puzzle pieces are very heavy, so Hongcow cannot rotate or flip the puzzle pieces. However, he is allowed to move them in any directions. The puzzle pieces also cannot overlap.\n\nYou are given as input the description of one of the pieces. Determine if it is possible to make a rectangle from two identical copies of the given input. The rectangle should be solid, i.e. there should be no empty holes inside it or on its border. Keep in mind that Hongcow is not allowed to flip or rotate pieces and they cannot overlap, i.e. no two 'X' from different pieces can share the same position.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input will contain two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=500), the dimensions of the puzzle piece.\n\nThe next *n* lines will describe the jigsaw piece. Each line will have length *m* and will consist of characters '.' and 'X' only. 'X' corresponds to a part of the puzzle piece, '.' is an empty space.\n\nIt is guaranteed there is at least one 'X' character in the input and that the 'X' characters form a 4-connected region.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput \"YES\" if it is possible for Hongcow to make a rectangle. Output \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 3\\nXXX\\nXXX\\n', '2 2\\n.X\\nXX\\n', '5 5\\n.....\\n..X..\\n.....\\n.....\\n.....\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\n\nNote:\nFor the first sample, one example of a rectangle we can form is as follows \n\nFor the second sample, it is impossible to put two of those pieces without rotating or flipping to form a rectangle.\n\nIn the third sample, we can shift the first tile by one to the right, and then compose the following rectangle:",

He was working hard at the robot. He taught it to walk the shortest path from one point to another, to record all its movements, but like in many Draude's programs, there was a bug \u2014 the robot didn't always walk the shortest path. Fortunately, the robot recorded its own movements correctly. Now Draude wants to find out when his robot functions wrong. Heh, if Draude only remembered the map of the field, where he tested the robot, he would easily say if the robot walked in the right direction or not. But the field map was lost never to be found, that's why he asks you to find out if there exist at least one map, where the path recorded by the robot is the shortest.\n\nThe map is an infinite checkered field, where each square is either empty, or contains an obstruction. It is also known that the robot never tries to run into the obstruction. By the recorded robot's movements find out if there exist at least one such map, that it is possible to choose for the robot a starting square (the starting square should be empty) such that when the robot moves from this square its movements coincide with the recorded ones (the robot doesn't run into anything, moving along empty squares only), and the path from the starting square to the end one is the shortest.\n\nIn one movement the robot can move into the square (providing there are no obstrutions in this square) that has common sides with the square the robot is currently in.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input file contains the recording of the robot's movements. This recording is a non-empty string, consisting of uppercase Latin letters L, R, U and D, standing for movements left, right, up and down respectively. The length of the string does not exceed 100.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line output the only word OK (if the above described map exists), or BUG (if such a map does not exist).\n\nDemo Input:\n['LLUUUR\\n', 'RRUULLDD\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['OK\\n', 'BUG\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

He has already made up his mind that the basic image transformations in his editor will be: rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise, flip the image horizontally (symmetry relative to the vertical line, that is, the right part of the image moves to the left, and vice versa) and zooming on the image. He is sure that that there is a large number of transformations that can be expressed through these three.\n\nHe has recently stopped implementing all three transformations for monochrome images. To test this feature, he asked you to write a code that will consecutively perform three actions with a monochrome image: first it will rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise, then it will flip the image horizontally and finally, it will zoom in twice on the image (that is, it will double all the linear sizes).\n\nImplement this feature to help Polycarp test his editor.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers, *w* and *h* (1<=\u2264<=*w*,<=*h*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the width and height of an image in pixels.

        "prompt": "Title: Pacifist frogs\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 64 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThumbelina has had an accident. She has found herself on a little island in the middle of a swamp and wants to get to the shore very much.\n\nOne can get to the shore only by hills that are situated along a straight line that connects the little island with the shore. Let us assume that the hills are numbered from 1 to *n* and the number of a hill is equal to the distance in meters between it and the island. The distance between the *n*-th hill and the shore is also 1 meter.\n\nThumbelina is too small to make such jumps. Fortunately, a family of frogs living in the swamp suggests to help her. Each frog agrees to give Thumbelina a ride but Thumbelina should choose only one frog. Each frog has a certain jump length. If Thumbelina agrees to accept help from a frog whose jump length is *d*, the frog will jump from the island on the hill *d*, then \u2014 on the hill 2*d*, then 3*d* and so on until they get to the shore (i.e. find itself beyond the hill *n*).\n\nHowever, there is one more problem: mosquitoes also live in the swamp. At the moment they have a siesta, and they are having a nap on some hills. If the frog jumps on a hill with a mosquito the frog will smash it. The frogs Thumbelina has met are pacifists, so they will find the death of each mosquito very much sad. Help Thumbelina choose a frog that will bring her to the shore and smash as small number of mosquitoes as possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109, 1<=\u2264<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of hills, frogs and mosquitoes respectively.

The third line contains *k* integers \u2014 the numbers of the hills on which each mosquito is sleeping. No more than one mosquito can sleep on each hill. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line output the number of frogs that smash the minimal number of mosquitoes, in the second line \u2014 their numbers in increasing order separated by spaces.

And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts *k* days!\n\nWhen Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last *n* days. So now he has a sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where *a**i* is the sleep time on the *i*-th day.\n\nThe number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider *k* consecutive days as a week. So there will be *n*<=-<=*k*<=+<=1 weeks to take into consideration.

        "prompt": "Title: Little Artem and Matrix\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLittle Artem likes electronics. He can spend lots of time making different schemas and looking for novelties in the nearest electronics store. The new control element was delivered to the store recently and Artem immediately bought it.\n\nThat element can store information about the matrix of integers size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*. There are *n*<=+<=*m* inputs in that element, i.e. each row and each column can get the signal. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some row, this row cyclically shifts to the left, that is the first element of the row becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. When signal comes to the input corresponding to some column, that column shifts cyclically to the top, that is first element of the column becomes last element, second element becomes first and so on. Rows are numbered with integers from 1 to *n* from top to bottom, while columns are numbered with integers from 1 to *m* from left to right.\n\nArtem wants to carefully study this element before using it. For that purpose he is going to set up an experiment consisting of *q* turns. On each turn he either sends the signal to some input or checks what number is stored at some position of the matrix.\n\nArtem has completed his experiment and has written down the results, but he has lost the chip! Help Artem find any initial matrix that will match the experiment results. It is guaranteed that experiment data is consistent, which means at least one valid matrix exists.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains three integers *n*, *m* and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=10<=000)\u00a0\u2014 dimensions of the matrix and the number of turns in the experiment, respectively.\n\nNext *q* lines contain turns descriptions, one per line. Each description starts with an integer *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=3) that defines the type of the operation. For the operation of first and second type integer *r**i* (1<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) or *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*) follows, while for the operations of the third type three integers *r**i*, *c**i* and *x**i* (1<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*, <=-<=109<=\u2264<=*x**i*<=\u2264<=109) are given.\n\nOperation of the first type (*t**i*<==<=1) means that signal comes to the input corresponding to row *r**i*, that is it will shift cyclically. Operation of the second type (*t**i*<==<=2) means that column *c**i* will shift cyclically. Finally, operation of the third type means that at this moment of time cell located in the row *r**i* and column *c**i* stores value *x**i*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the description of any valid initial matrix as *n* lines containing *m* integers each.

        "prompt": "Title: PolandBall and Forest\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPolandBall lives in a forest with his family. There are some trees in the forest. Trees are undirected acyclic graphs with *k* vertices and *k*<=-<=1 edges, where *k* is some integer. Note that one vertex is a valid tree.\n\nThere is exactly one relative living in each vertex of each tree, they have unique ids from 1 to *n*. For each Ball *i* we know the id of its most distant relative living on the same tree. If there are several such vertices, we only know the value of the one with smallest id among those.\n\nHow many trees are there in the forest?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Balls living in the forest.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* of length *n*, where (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) holds and *p**i* denotes the most distant from Ball *i* relative living on the same tree. If there are several most distant relatives living on the same tree, *p**i* is the id of one with the smallest id.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sequence *p* corresponds to some valid forest.\n\nHacking: To hack someone, you should provide a correct forest as a test. The sequence *p* will be calculated according to the forest and given to the solution you try to hack as input. Use the following format:\n\nIn the first line, output the integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104)\u00a0\u2014 the number of Balls and the integer *m* (0<=\u2264<=*m*<=&lt;<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the total number of edges in the forest. Then *m* lines should follow. The *i*-th of them should contain two integers *a**i* and *b**i* and represent an edge between vertices in which relatives *a**i* and *b**i* live. For example, the first sample is written as follows:\n\nOutput Specification:\nYou should output the number of trees in the forest where PolandBall lives.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n2 1 5 3 3', '1\\n1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2', '1']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample testcase, possible forest is: 1-2 3-4-5. \n\nThere are 2 trees overall.\n\nIn the second sample testcase, the only possible graph is one vertex and no edges.

        "prompt": "Title: Suffix Structures\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nBizon the Champion isn't just a bison. He also is a favorite of the \"Bizons\" team.\n\nAt a competition the \"Bizons\" got the following problem: \"You are given two distinct words (strings of English letters), *s* and *t*. You need to transform word *s* into word *t*\". The task looked simple to the guys because they know the suffix data structures well. Bizon Senior loves suffix automaton. By applying it once to a string, he can remove from this string any single character. Bizon Middle knows suffix array well. By applying it once to a string, he can swap any two characters of this string. The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more. \n\nBizon the Champion wonders whether the \"Bizons\" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it? Can they solve it either only with use of suffix automaton or only with use of suffix array or they need both structures? Note that any structure may be used an unlimited number of times, the structures may be used in any order.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a non-empty word *s*. The second line contains a non-empty word *t*. Words *s* and *t* are different. Each word consists only of lowercase English letters. Each word contains at most 100 letters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the single line print the answer to the problem. Print \"need tree\" (without the quotes) if word *s* cannot be transformed into word *t* even with use of both suffix array and suffix automaton. Print \"automaton\" (without the quotes) if you need only the suffix automaton to solve the problem. Print \"array\" (without the quotes) if you need only the suffix array to solve the problem. Print \"both\" (without the quotes), if you need both data structures to solve the problem.\n\nIt's guaranteed that if you can solve the problem only with use of suffix array, then it is impossible to solve it only with use of suffix automaton. This is also true for suffix automaton.\n\nDemo Input:\n['automaton\\ntomat\\n', 'array\\narary\\n', 'both\\nhot\\n', 'need\\ntree\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['automaton\\n', 'array\\n', 'both\\n', 'need tree\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the third sample you can act like that: first transform \"both\" into \"oth\" by removing the first character using the suffix automaton and then make two swaps of the string using the suffix array and get \"hot\".",

Then she starts moving in the snake fashion \u2014 all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up.

As a result, in $k$ days he will solve all the $n$ problems.\n\nThe profit of the $j$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $j$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $l$ to $r$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $k$ days of his practice.\n\nYou want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $n$ problems between $k$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.\n\nFor example, if $n = 8, k = 3$ and $a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$. Here the total profit equals $5 + 6 + 9 = 20$.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$) \u2014 the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$) \u2014 difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.\n\nIn the second line print exactly $k$ positive integers $t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$ ($t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$ must equal $n$), where $t_j$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $j$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.\n\nIf there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2\\n', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5\\n', '4000\\n2 2\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second example there is only one possible distribution.\n\nIn the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$. The total profit of this distribution is $2000 + 2000 = 4000$.",

Each promo code consists of exactly six digits and gives right to one free cocktail at the bar \"Mosquito Shelter\". Of course, all the promocodes differ.\n\nAs the \"Mosquito Shelter\" opens only at 9, and partying in Sudislavl usually begins at as early as 6, many problems may arise as to how to type a promotional code without errors. It is necessary to calculate such maximum *k*, that the promotional code could be uniquely identified if it was typed with no more than *k* errors. At that, *k*<==<=0 means that the promotional codes must be entered exactly.\n\nA mistake in this problem should be considered as entering the wrong numbers.

Initially, Vasya's bank account is at 0.\n\nAlso, each minute Vasya's bank account receives *C*\u00b7*k*, where *k* is the amount of received but unread messages.\n\nVasya's messages are very important to him, and because of that he wants to have all messages read after *T* minutes.\n\nDetermine the maximum amount of money Vasya's bank account can hold after *T* minutes.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains five integers *n*, *A*, *B*, *C* and *T* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*A*,<=*B*,<=*C*,<=*T*<=\u2264<=1000).\n\nThe second string contains *n* integers *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=*T*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput one integer \u00a0\u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 5 5 3 5\\n1 5 5 4\\n', '5 3 1 1 3\\n2 2 2 1 1\\n', '5 5 3 4 5\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['20\\n', '15\\n', '35\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the messages must be read immediately after receiving, Vasya receives *A* points for each message, *n*\u00b7*A*\u2009=\u200920 in total.\n\nIn the second sample the messages can be read at any integer moment.\n\nIn the third sample messages must be read at the moment T. This way Vasya has 1, 2, 3, 4 and 0 unread messages at the corresponding minutes, he gets 40 points for them. When reading messages, he receives (5\u2009-\u20094\u00b73)\u2009+\u2009(5\u2009-\u20093\u00b73)\u2009+\u2009(5\u2009-\u20092\u00b73)\u2009+\u2009(5\u2009-\u20091\u00b73)\u2009+\u20095\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20095 points.

        "prompt": "Title: The Modcrab\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVova is again playing some computer game, now an RPG. In the game Vova's character received a quest: to slay the fearsome monster called Modcrab.\n\nAfter two hours of playing the game Vova has tracked the monster and analyzed its tactics. The Modcrab has *h*2 health points and an attack power of *a*2. Knowing that, Vova has decided to buy a lot of strong healing potions and to prepare for battle.\n\nVova's character has *h*1 health points and an attack power of *a*1. Also he has a large supply of healing potions, each of which increases his current amount of health points by *c*1 when Vova drinks a potion. All potions are identical to each other. It is guaranteed that *c*1<=&gt;<=*a*2.\n\nThe battle consists of multiple phases. In the beginning of each phase, Vova can either attack the monster (thus reducing its health by *a*1) or drink a healing potion (it increases Vova's health by *c*1; Vova's health can exceed *h*1). Then, if the battle is not over yet, the Modcrab attacks Vova, reducing his health by *a*2. The battle ends when Vova's (or Modcrab's) health drops to 0 or lower. It is possible that the battle ends in a middle of a phase after Vova's attack.\n\nOf course, Vova wants to win the fight. But also he wants to do it as fast as possible. So he wants to make up a strategy that will allow him to win the fight after the minimum possible number of phases.\n\nHelp Vova to make up a strategy! You may assume that Vova never runs out of healing potions, and that he can always win.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *h*1, *a*1, *c*1 (1<=\u2264<=*h*1,<=*a*1<=\u2264<=100, 2<=\u2264<=*c*1<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 Vova's health, Vova's attack power and the healing power of a potion.\n\nThe second line contains two integers *h*2, *a*2 (1<=\u2264<=*h*2<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*a*2<=&lt;<=*c*1) \u2014 the Modcrab's health and his attack power.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print one integer *n* denoting the minimum number of phases required to win the battle.\n\nThen print *n* lines. *i*-th line must be equal to HEAL if Vova drinks a potion in *i*-th phase, or STRIKE if he attacks the Modcrab.\n\nThe strategy must be valid: Vova's character must not be defeated before slaying the Modcrab, and the monster's health must be 0 or lower after Vova's last action.\n\nIf there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['10 6 100\\n17 5\\n', '11 6 100\\n12 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\nSTRIKE\\nHEAL\\nSTRIKE\\nSTRIKE\\n', '2\\nSTRIKE\\nSTRIKE\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Vova's character must heal before or after his first attack. Otherwise his health will drop to zero in 2 phases while he needs 3 strikes to win.\n\nIn the second example no healing needed, two strikes are enough to get monster to zero health and win with 6 health left.",

Some characters are friends to each other, and they share information they got. Also Vova knows that he can bribe each character so he or she starts spreading the rumor; *i*-th character wants *c**i* gold in exchange for spreading the rumor.

Today the supermarket has a special offer of discount systems.\n\nThere are *m* types of discounts. We assume that the discounts are indexed from 1 to *m*. To use the discount number *i*, the customer takes a special basket, where he puts exactly *q**i* items he buys. Under the terms of the discount system, in addition to the items in the cart the customer can receive at most two items from the supermarket for free. The number of the \"free items\" (0, 1 or 2) to give is selected by the customer. The only condition imposed on the selected \"free items\" is as follows: each of them mustn't be more expensive than the cheapest item out of the *q**i* items in the cart.\n\nMaxim now needs to buy *n* items in the shop. Count the minimum sum of money that Maxim needs to buy them, if he use the discount system optimally well.\n\nPlease assume that the supermarket has enough carts for any actions. Maxim can use the same discount multiple times.

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. \n\nThe content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.\n\nAnd he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string *s* with the following structure:\n -  if *s**i* = \"?\", then the digit that goes *i*-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively); -  if *s**i* is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit *s**i* on position *i* in code; -  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. -  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. \nFor example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".\n\nAfter receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.\n\nAt a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ... Help him to determine the number of possible variants of the code to the safe, matching the given hint. After receiving this information, and knowing his own speed of entering codes, the Smart Beaver will be able to determine whether he will have time for tonight's show \"Beavers are on the trail\" on his favorite TV channel, or he should work for a sleepless night...\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains string *s* \u2014 the hint to the safe code. String *s* consists of the following characters: ?, 0-9, A-J. It is guaranteed that the first character of string *s* doesn't equal to character 0.\n\nThe input limits for scoring 30 points are (subproblem A1): \n -  1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=5. \nThe input limits for scoring 100 points are (subproblems A1+A2): \n -  1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=105. \nHere |*s*| means the length of string *s*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the number of codes that match the given hint.\n\nDemo Input:\n['AJ\\n', '1?AA\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['81\\n', '100\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: What is for dinner?\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a lovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".\n\nFor a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).\n\nIt turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. \n\nUnhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative. \n\nAs Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner.\n\nWe should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner.

Unfortunately, he forgot to actually assign the directions to digits.\n\nThe robot will choose some random mapping of digits to distinct directions. The robot will map distinct digits to distinct directions. The robot will then follow the instructions according to the given string in order and chosen mapping. If an instruction would lead the robot to go off the edge of the maze or hit an obstacle, the robot will crash and break down. If the robot reaches the exit at any point, then the robot will stop following any further instructions.\n\nBob is having trouble debugging his robot, so he would like to determine the number of mappings of digits to directions that would lead the robot to the exit.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input will contain two integers *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=50), denoting the dimensions of the maze.\n\nThe next *n* lines will contain exactly *m* characters each, denoting the maze.\n\nEach character of the maze will be '.', '#', 'S', or 'E'.\n\nThere will be exactly one 'S' and exactly one 'E' in the maze.\n\nThe last line will contain a single string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the instructions given to the robot. Each character of *s* is a digit from 0 to 3.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer, the number of mappings of digits to directions that will lead the robot to the exit.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 6\\n.....#\\nS....#\\n.#....\\n.#....\\n...E..\\n333300012\\n', '6 6\\n......\\n......\\n..SE..\\n......\\n......\\n......\\n01232123212302123021\\n', '5 3\\n...\\n.S.\\n###\\n.E.\\n...\\n3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '14\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nFor the first sample, the only valid mapping is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/87a55361bde12e4223a96f0e1d83b94428f26f02.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, where *D* is down, *L* is left, *U* is up, *R* is right.",

Their puzzles consist of a 2<=\u00d7<=2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below:\n\nIn order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first two lines of the input consist of a 2<=\u00d7<=2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2<=\u00d7<=2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput \"YES\"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs).

In the kitchen Volodya found out that he has *b*1,<=...,<=*b**n* litres of these ingredients at his disposal correspondingly. In order to correct his algebra mistakes he ought to cook as much soup as possible in a *V* litres volume pan (which means the amount of soup cooked can be between 0 and *V* litres).

        "prompt": "Title: PawnChess\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nGalois is one of the strongest chess players of Byteforces. He has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named \u00abPawnChess\u00bb.\n\nThis new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed. \n\nLets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (*r*,<=*c*) the cell located at the row *r* and at the column *c*.\n\nThere are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=-<=1,<=*c*), while moving down means the pawn located in (*r*,<=*c*) will go to the cell (*r*<=+<=1,<=*c*). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. \n\nIt's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint 'A' if player A wins the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the victory. Again, it's guaranteed that there will always be a winner on the given board.\n\nDemo Input:\n['........\\n........\\n.B....B.\\n....W...\\n........\\n..W.....\\n........\\n........\\n', '..B.....\\n..W.....\\n......B.\\n........\\n.....W..\\n......B.\\n........\\n........\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['A\\n', 'B\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample player A is able to complete his goal in 3 steps by always moving a pawn initially located at (4,\u20095). Player B needs at least 5 steps for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner.",

Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex *n*-gon (regular convex polygon with *n* sides).\n\nThat's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices *v*1, *v*2, *v*3 such that the angle  (where *v*2 is the vertex of the angle, and *v*1 and *v*3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to *a*. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.\n\nIf there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\nInput Specification:\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *a* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=180)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices *v*1, *v*2, *v*3, which form .

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45\u2009-\u200967|\u2009&lt;\u2009|90\u2009-\u200967|.

The queries should be processed one after another in the order they are given.\n\nOne operation of a cyclic shift (rotation) is equivalent to moving the last character to the position of the first character and shifting all other characters one position to the right.\n\nFor example, if the string *s* is abacaba and the query is *l*1<==<=3,<=*r*1<==<=6,<=*k*1<==<=1 then the answer is abbacaa.

Indeed, she has spent some time reading several recipe books, including the universally acclaimed \"The Art of the Covfefe\".\n\nShe knows *n* coffee recipes. The *i*-th recipe suggests that coffee should be brewed between *l**i* and *r**i* degrees, inclusive, to achieve the optimal taste.\n\nKaren thinks that a temperature is admissible if at least *k* recipes recommend it.\n\nKaren has a rather fickle mind, and so she asks *q* questions. In each question, given that she only wants to prepare coffee with a temperature between *a* and *b*, inclusive, can you tell her how many admissible integer temperatures fall within the range?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains three integers, *n*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=200000), and *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=200000), the number of recipes, the minimum number of recipes a certain temperature must be recommended by to be admissible, and the number of questions Karen has, respectively.\n\nThe next *n* lines describe the recipes.

The game goes like that: the players take turns to choose a cube of some color (red or blue) and put it in a line from left to right (overall the line will have *n*<=+<=*m* cubes). Petya moves first. Petya's task is to get as many pairs of neighbouring cubes of the same color as possible. Vasya's task is to get as many pairs of neighbouring cubes of different colors as possible. \n\nThe number of Petya's points in the game is the number of pairs of neighboring cubes of the same color in the line, the number of Vasya's points in the game is the number of neighbouring cubes of the different color in the line. Your task is to calculate the score at the end of the game (Petya's and Vasya's points, correspondingly), if both boys are playing optimally well.

In total, there are *n* tasks for the day and each animal should do each of these tasks. For each task, they have evaluated its difficulty. Also animals decided to do the tasks in order of their difficulty. Unfortunately, some tasks can have the same difficulty, so the order in which one can perform the tasks may vary.\n\nMenshykov, Uslada and Horace ask you to deal with this nuisance and come up with individual plans for each of them. The plan is a sequence describing the order in which an animal should do all the *n* tasks. Besides, each of them wants to have its own unique plan. Therefore three plans must form three different sequences. You are to find the required plans, or otherwise deliver the sad news to them by stating that it is impossible to come up with three distinct plans for the given tasks.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of tasks. The second line contains *n* integers *h*1,<=*h*2,<=...,<=*h**n* (1<=\u2264<=*h**i*<=\u2264<=2000), where *h**i* is the difficulty of the *i*-th task.

You can print any three of them in the answer.\n\nIn the second sample there are only two sequences of tasks that meet the conditions \u2014 [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] and [3, 1, 4, 2, 5].

Since they were files in the BerFS file system, it is known that each file name has a form \"name.ext\", where: \n -  name is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, its length is from 1 to 8 characters; -  ext is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, its length is from 1 to 3 characters. \nFor example, \"read.me\", \"example.txt\" and \"b.cpp\" are valid file names and \"version.info\", \"ntldr\" and \"contestdata.zip\" are not.\n\nDamage to the list meant that all the file names were recorded one after another, without any separators. So now Eudokimus has a single string.\n\nEudokimus needs to set everything right as soon as possible. He should divide the resulting string into parts so that each part would be a valid file name in BerFS. Since Eudokimus has already proved that he is not good at programming, help him.

Note: it is clear that Vasya is a law-abiding hacker, and made it for a noble purpose \u2014 to show the developer the imperfection of their protection.\n\nThe found algorithm looks the following way. At first the digits of the number are shuffled in the following order &lt;first digit&gt;&lt;third digit&gt;&lt;fifth digit&gt;&lt;fourth digit&gt;&lt;second digit&gt;. For example the shuffle of 12345 should lead to 13542. On the second stage the number is raised to the fifth power.

Therefore, some of the citizens of the capital now demand to explain the need for this system and the benefits that its implementation will bring. Now, the developers of the system need to urgently come up with reasons for its existence.\n\nHelp the system developers to find the minimum possible capacity of the reading room (in visitors) using the log of the system available to you.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of records in the system log. Next follow *n* events from the system journal in the order in which the were made. Each event was written on a single line and looks as \"+ *r**i*\" or \"- *r**i*\", where *r**i* is an integer from 1 to 106, the registration number of the visitor (that is, distinct visitors always have distinct registration numbers).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the log is not contradictory, that is, for every visitor the types of any of his two consecutive events are distinct. Before starting the system, and after stopping the room may possibly contain visitors.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible capacity of the reading room.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\n+ 12001\\n- 12001\\n- 1\\n- 1200\\n+ 1\\n+ 7\\n', '2\\n- 1\\n- 2\\n', '2\\n+ 1\\n- 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3', '2', '1']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample test, the system log will ensure that at some point in the reading room were visitors with registration numbers 1, 1200 and 12001. More people were not in the room at the same time based on the log. Therefore, the answer to the test is 3.",

        "prompt": "Title: Dima and To-do List\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nYou helped Dima to have a great weekend, but it's time to work. Naturally, Dima, as all other men who have girlfriends, does everything wrong.\n\nInna and Dima are now in one room. Inna tells Dima off for everything he does in her presence. After Inna tells him off for something, she goes to another room, walks there in circles muttering about how useless her sweetheart is. During that time Dima has time to peacefully complete *k*<=-<=1 tasks. Then Inna returns and tells Dima off for the next task he does in her presence and goes to another room again. It continues until Dima is through with his tasks.\n\nOverall, Dima has *n* tasks to do, each task has a unique number from 1 to *n*. Dima loves order, so he does tasks consecutively, starting from some task. For example, if Dima has 6 tasks to do in total, then, if he starts from the 5-th task, the order is like that: first Dima does the 5-th task, then the 6-th one, then the 1-st one, then the 2-nd one, then the 3-rd one, then the 4-th one.\n\nInna tells Dima off (only lovingly and appropriately!) so often and systematically that he's very well learned the power with which she tells him off for each task. Help Dima choose the first task so that in total he gets told off with as little power as possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n*,<=*k*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105). The second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=103), where *a**i* is the power Inna tells Dima off with if she is present in the room while he is doing the *i*-th task.\n\nIt is guaranteed that *n* is divisible by *k*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn a single line print the number of the task Dima should start with to get told off with as little power as possible. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number of the first task to do.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6 2\\n3 2 1 6 5 4\\n', '10 5\\n1 3 5 7 9 9 4 1 8 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '3\\n']\n\nNote:\nExplanation of the first example.\n\nIf Dima starts from the first task, Inna tells him off with power 3, then Dima can do one more task (as *k* = 2), then Inna tells him off for the third task with power 1, then she tells him off for the fifth task with power 5. Thus, Dima gets told off with total power 3 + 1 + 5 = 9. If Dima started from the second task, for example, then Inna would tell him off for tasks 2, 4 and 6 with power 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \n\nExplanation of the second example.\n\nIn the second example *k* = 5, thus, Dima manages to complete 4 tasks in-between the telling off sessions. Thus, Inna tells Dima off for tasks number 1 and 6 (if he starts from 1 or 6), 2 and 7 (if he starts from 2 or 7) and so on. The optimal answer is to start from task 3 or 8, 3 has a smaller number, so the answer is 3.",

These sections are connected by a chain: the 1-st section is adjacent only to the 2-nd one, the 2-nd one \u2014 to the 1-st and the 3-rd ones, the 3-rd one \u2014 only to the 2-nd one. The transitions are possible only between the adjacent sections.\n\nThe spacecraft team consists of *n* aliens. Each of them is given a rank \u2014 an integer from 1 to *n*. The ranks of all astronauts are distinct. The rules established on the Saucer, state that an alien may move from section *a* to section *b* only if it is senior in rank to all aliens who are in the segments *a* and *b* (besides, the segments *a* and *b* are of course required to be adjacent). Any alien requires exactly 1 minute to make a move. Besides, safety regulations require that no more than one alien moved at the same minute along the ship.\n\nAlien *A* is senior in rank to alien *B*, if the number indicating rank *A*, is more than the corresponding number for *B*.\n\nAt the moment the whole saucer team is in the 3-rd segment. They all need to move to the 1-st segment. One member of the crew, the alien with the identification number CFR-140, decided to calculate the minimum time (in minutes) they will need to perform this task.\n\nHelp CFR-140, figure out the minimum time (in minutes) that all the astronauts will need to move from the 3-rd segment to the 1-st one. Since this number can be rather large, count it modulo *m*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers: *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the number of aliens on the saucer and the number, modulo which you should print the answer, correspondingly.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo *m*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1 10\\n', '3 8\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the only crew member moves from segment 3 to segment 2, and then from segment 2 to segment 1 without any problems. Thus, the whole moving will take two minutes.\n\nTo briefly describe the movements in the second sample we will use value <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/4c7c8e716067e9c6251e8ca82a4ca7fde74fbacb.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, which would correspond to an alien with rank *i* moving from the segment in which it is at the moment, to the segment number *j*. Using these values, we will describe the movements between the segments in the second sample: <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7668900e59f9bc3ccc78b0a77dca322fcb02fa04.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1adb8798904e42944c35bd49feff02db6c3ea10b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/954e2f634474269f53df1edbf2e7b214d8a2611c.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7668900e59f9bc3ccc78b0a77dca322fcb02fa04.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/be5f59dacfc6f7ded42f8f260c7b7aedf17ec1f0.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/d4fd9e68a9c6a277942eb188291d6d2744ea21d3.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7668900e59f9bc3ccc78b0a77dca322fcb02fa04.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1adb8798904e42944c35bd49feff02db6c3ea10b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b73a9870e1b41a5e048c3ab3e3fd4b92c336c9ec.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7668900e59f9bc3ccc78b0a77dca322fcb02fa04.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/be5f59dacfc6f7ded42f8f260c7b7aedf17ec1f0.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/954e2f634474269f53df1edbf2e7b214d8a2611c.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7668900e59f9bc3ccc78b0a77dca322fcb02fa04.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1adb8798904e42944c35bd49feff02db6c3ea10b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/49b1ffd4dcd2e0da0acec04559e0c3efc7854b07.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7668900e59f9bc3ccc78b0a77dca322fcb02fa04.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/be5f59dacfc6f7ded42f8f260c7b7aedf17ec1f0.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ef8b3f32ee76c86f57fa63f7251fa290642f17f8.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7668900e59f9bc3ccc78b0a77dca322fcb02fa04.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1adb8798904e42944c35bd49feff02db6c3ea10b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/954e2f634474269f53df1edbf2e7b214d8a2611c.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7668900e59f9bc3ccc78b0a77dca322fcb02fa04.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/be5f59dacfc6f7ded42f8f260c7b7aedf17ec1f0.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/d4fd9e68a9c6a277942eb188291d6d2744ea21d3.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7668900e59f9bc3ccc78b0a77dca322fcb02fa04.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1adb8798904e42944c35bd49feff02db6c3ea10b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>; In total: the aliens need 26 moves.

He wants to win in upcoming elections and rule over the Bearland.\n\nThere are *n* candidates, including Limak. We know how many citizens are going to vote for each candidate. Now *i*-th candidate would get *a**i* votes. Limak is candidate number 1. To win in elections, he must get strictly more votes than any other candidate.\n\nVictory is more important than everything else so Limak decided to cheat. He will steal votes from his opponents by bribing some citizens. To bribe a citizen, Limak must give him or her one candy - citizens are bears and bears like candies. Limak doesn't have many candies and wonders - how many citizens does he have to bribe?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) - number of candidates.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=1000) - number of votes for each candidate.

Alternatively, Limak could steal only 3 votes from the third candidate and 1 vote from the second candidate to get situation 9,\u20090,\u20098,\u20092,\u20098.\n\nIn the second sample Limak will steal 2 votes from each candidate.

        "prompt": "Title: T-Shirt Hunt\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nNot so long ago the Codecraft-17 contest was held on Codeforces. The top 25 participants, and additionally random 25 participants out of those who got into top 500, will receive a Codeforces T-shirt.\n\nUnfortunately, you didn't manage to get into top 25, but you got into top 500, taking place *p*.\n\nNow the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017 is being held. It has been announced that the Codecraft-17 T-shirt winners will be chosen as follows. Let *s* be the number of points of the winner of the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017. Then the following pseudocode will be executed: \n\nHere \"div\" is the integer division operator, \"mod\" is the modulo (the remainder of division) operator.\n\nAs the result of pseudocode execution, 25 integers between 26 and 500, inclusive, will be printed. These will be the numbers of places of the participants who get the Codecraft-17 T-shirts. It is guaranteed that the 25 printed integers will be pairwise distinct for any value of *s*.\n\nYou're in the lead of the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017, having *x* points. You believe that having at least *y* points in the current round will be enough for victory.\n\nTo change your final score, you can make any number of successful and unsuccessful hacks. A successful hack brings you 100 points, an unsuccessful one takes 50 points from you. It's difficult to do successful hacks, though.\n\nYou want to win the current round and, at the same time, ensure getting a Codecraft-17 T-shirt. What is the smallest number of successful hacks you have to do to achieve that?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line contains three integers *p*, *x* and *y* (26<=\u2264<=*p*<=\u2264<=500; 1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=20000)\u00a0\u2014 your place in Codecraft-17, your current score in the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017, and the smallest number of points you consider sufficient for winning the current round.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the smallest number of successful hacks you have to do in order to both win the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017 and ensure getting a Codecraft-17 T-shirt.\n\nIt's guaranteed that your goal is achievable for any valid input data.\n\nDemo Input:\n['239 10880 9889\\n', '26 7258 6123\\n', '493 8000 8000\\n', '101 6800 6500\\n', '329 19913 19900\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0\\n', '2\\n', '24\\n', '0\\n', '8\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, there is no need to do any hacks since 10880 points already bring the T-shirt to the 239-th place of Codecraft-17 (that is, you). In this case, according to the pseudocode, the T-shirts will be given to the participants at the following places: \n\nIn the second example, you have to do two successful and one unsuccessful hack to make your score equal to 7408.\n\nIn the third example, you need to do as many as 24 successful hacks to make your score equal to 10400.\n\nIn the fourth example, it's sufficient to do 6 unsuccessful hacks (and no successful ones) to make your score equal to 6500, which is just enough for winning the current round and also getting the T-shirt.",

This morning the Three-Dimensional kingdom declared war on the Two-dimensional one. This (possibly armed) conflict will determine the ultimate owner of the straight line.\n\nThe Two-dimensional kingdom has a regular army of *n* people. Each soldier registered himself and indicated the desired size of the bulletproof vest: the *i*-th soldier indicated size *a**i*. The soldiers are known to be unpretentious, so the command staff assumes that the soldiers are comfortable in any vests with sizes from *a**i*<=-<=*x* to *a**i*<=+<=*y*, inclusive (numbers *x*,<=*y*<=\u2265<=0 are specified). \n\nThe Two-dimensional kingdom has *m* vests at its disposal, the *j*-th vest's size equals *b**j*. Help mobilize the Two-dimensional kingdom's army: equip with vests as many soldiers as possible. Each vest can be used only once. The *i*-th soldier can put on the *j*-th vest, if *a**i*<=-<=*x*<=\u2264<=*b**j*<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=+<=*y*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains four integers *n*, *m*, *x* and *y* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105, 0<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the number of soldiers, the number of vests and two numbers that specify the soldiers' unpretentiousness, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) in non-decreasing order, separated by single spaces \u2014 the desired sizes of vests. \n\nThe third line contains *m* integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**m* (1<=\u2264<=*b**j*<=\u2264<=109) in non-decreasing order, separated by single spaces \u2014 the sizes of the available vests.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print a single integer *k* \u2014 the maximum number of soldiers equipped with bulletproof vests. \n\nIn the next *k* lines print *k* pairs, one pair per line, as \"*u**i* *v**i*\" (without the quotes). Pair (*u**i*, *v**i*) means that soldier number *u**i* must wear vest number *v**i*. Soldiers and vests are numbered starting from one in the order in which they are specified in the input. All numbers of soldiers in the pairs should be pairwise different, all numbers of vests in the pairs also should be pairwise different.

This sample allows another answer, which gives the second vest to the fourth soldier instead of the third one.\n\nIn the second sample the vest size can differ from the desired size by at most 2 sizes, so all soldiers can be equipped.",

For each square we know how many tons of corn grows on it. The father, an old farmer did not love all three sons equally, which is why he bequeathed to divide his field into three parts containing *A*, *B* and *C* tons of corn.\n\nThe field should be divided by two parallel lines. The lines should be parallel to one side of the field and to each other. The lines should go strictly between the squares of the field. Each resulting part of the field should consist of at least one square. \n\nYour task is to find the number of ways to divide the field as is described above, that is, to mark two lines, dividing the field in three parts so that on one of the resulting parts grew *A* tons of corn, *B* on another one and *C* on the remaining one.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains space-separated integers *n* and *m* \u2014 the sizes of the original (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=50,<=*max*(*n*,<=*m*)<=\u2265<=3).

No wonder Volodya is especially interested in texts concerning his favourite music style.\n\nVolodya calls a string powerful if it starts with \"heavy\" and ends with \"metal\". Finding all powerful substrings (by substring Volodya means a subsequence of consecutive characters in a string) in a given text makes our hero especially joyful. Recently he felt an enormous fit of energy while reading a certain text. So Volodya decided to count all powerful substrings in this text and brag about it all day long. Help him in this difficult task. Two substrings are considered different if they appear at the different positions in the text.\n\nFor simplicity, let us assume that Volodya's text can be represented as a single string.\n\nInput Specification:\nInput contains a single non-empty string consisting of the lowercase Latin alphabet letters. Length of this string will not be greater than 106 characters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint exactly one number \u2014 the number of powerful substrings of the given string.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.

By the decision of BFA (Berland's Football Association) next World Cup will be held in Berland. BFA took the decision to change some World Cup regulations:\n -  the final tournament features *n* teams (*n* is always even) -  the first *n*<=/<=2 teams (according to the standings) come through to the knockout stage -  the standings are made on the following principle: for a victory a team gets 3 points, for a draw \u2014 1 point, for a defeat \u2014 0 points. In the first place, teams are ordered in the standings in decreasing order of their points; in the second place \u2014 in decreasing order of the difference between scored and missed goals; in the third place \u2014 in the decreasing order of scored goals -  it's written in Berland's Constitution that the previous regulation helps to order the teams without ambiguity. \nYou are asked to write a program that, by the given list of the competing teams and the results of all the matches, will find the list of teams that managed to get through to the knockout stage.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains the only integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50) \u2014 amount of the teams, taking part in the final tournament of World Cup. The following *n* lines contain the names of these teams, a name is a string of lower-case and upper-case Latin letters, its length doesn't exceed 30 characters. The following *n*\u00b7(*n*<=-<=1)<=/<=2 lines describe the held matches in the format name1-name2 num1:num2, where *name*1, *name*2 \u2014 names of the teams; *num*1, *num*2 (0<=\u2264<=*num*1,<=*num*2<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 amount of the goals, scored by the corresponding teams. Accuracy of the descriptions is guaranteed: there are no two team names coinciding accurate to the letters' case; there is no match, where a team plays with itself; each match is met in the descriptions only once.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput *n*<=/<=2 lines \u2014 names of the teams, which managed to get through to the knockout stage in lexicographical order.

They have the same size and weight, but they might have different strength. The *i*-th box can hold at most *x**i* boxes on its top (we'll call *x**i* the strength of the box). \n\nSince all the boxes have the same size, Ciel cannot put more than one box directly on the top of some box. For example, imagine Ciel has three boxes: the first has strength 2, the second has strength 1 and the third has strength 1. She cannot put the second and the third box simultaneously directly on the top of the first one. But she can put the second box directly on the top of the first one, and then the third box directly on the top of the second one. We will call such a construction of boxes a pile.\n\nFox Ciel wants to construct piles from all the boxes. Each pile will contain some boxes from top to bottom, and there cannot be more than *x**i* boxes on the top of *i*-th box.

        "prompt": "Title: Command Line Arguments\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe problem describes the properties of a command line. The description somehow resembles the one you usually see in real operating systems. However, there are differences in the behavior. Please make sure you've read the statement attentively and use it as a formal document.\n\nIn the Pindows operating system a strings are the lexemes of the command line \u2014 the first of them is understood as the name of the program to run and the following lexemes are its arguments. For example, as we execute the command \" run.exe one, two . \", we give four lexemes to the Pindows command line: \"run.exe\", \"one,\", \"two\", \".\". More formally, if we run a command that can be represented as string *s* (that has no quotes), then the command line lexemes are maximal by inclusion substrings of string *s* that contain no spaces.\n\nTo send a string with spaces or an empty string as a command line lexeme, we can use double quotes. The block of characters that should be considered as one lexeme goes inside the quotes. Embedded quotes are prohibited \u2014 that is, for each occurrence of character \"\"\" we should be able to say clearly that the quotes are opening or closing. For example, as we run the command \"\"run.exe o\" \"\" \" ne, \" two . \" \" \", we give six lexemes to the Pindows command line: \"run.exe o\", \"\" (an empty string), \" ne, \", \"two\", \".\", \" \" (a single space).\n\nIt is guaranteed that each lexeme of the command line is either surrounded by spaces on both sides or touches the corresponding command border. One of its consequences is: the opening brackets are either the first character of the string or there is a space to the left of them.\n\nYou have a string that consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters, digits, characters \".,?!\"\" and spaces. It is guaranteed that this string is a correct OS Pindows command line string. Print all lexemes of this command line string. Consider the character \"\"\" to be used only in order to denote a single block of characters into one command line lexeme. In particular, the consequence is that the given string has got an even number of such characters.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line contains a non-empty string *s*. String *s* consists of at most 105 characters. Each character is either an uppercase or a lowercase English letter, or a digit, or one of the \".,?!\"\" signs, or a space.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given string is some correct command line string of the OS Pindows. It is guaranteed that the given command line string contains at least one lexeme.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print the first lexeme, in the second line print the second one and so on. To make the output clearer, print the \"&lt;\" (less) character to the left of your lexemes and the \"&gt;\" (more) character to the right. Print the lexemes in the order in which they occur in the command.\n\nPlease, follow the given output format strictly. For more clarifications on the output format see the test samples.\n\nDemo Input:\n['\"RUn.exe O\" \"\" \"   2ne, \" two! . \" \"\\n', 'firstarg   second   \"\"    \\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['&lt;RUn.exe O&gt;\\n&lt;&gt;\\n&lt;   2ne, &gt;\\n&lt;two!&gt;\\n&lt;.&gt;\\n&lt; &gt;\\n', '&lt;firstarg&gt;\\n&lt;second&gt;\\n&lt;&gt;\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Alyona and flowers\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLittle Alyona is celebrating Happy Birthday! Her mother has an array of *n* flowers. Each flower has some mood, the mood of *i*-th flower is *a**i*. The mood can be positive, zero or negative.\n\nLet's define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The mother suggested some set of subarrays. Alyona wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother. After that, each of the flowers will add to the girl's happiness its mood multiplied by the number of chosen subarrays the flower is in.\n\nFor example, consider the case when the mother has 5 flowers, and their moods are equal to 1,<=<=-<=2,<=1,<=3,<=<=-<=4. Suppose the mother suggested subarrays (1,<=<=-<=2), (3,<=<=-<=4), (1,<=3), (1,<=<=-<=2,<=1,<=3). Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then: \n -  the first flower adds 1\u00b71<==<=1 to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the second flower adds (<=-<=2)\u00b71<==<=<=-<=2, because he is in one of chosen subarrays, -  the third flower adds 1\u00b72<==<=2, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fourth flower adds 3\u00b72<==<=6, because he is in two of chosen subarrays, -  the fifth flower adds (<=-<=4)\u00b70<==<=0, because he is in no chosen subarrays. \nThus, in total 1<=+<=(<=-<=2)<=+<=2<=+<=6<=+<=0<==<=7 is added to the girl's happiness. Alyona wants to choose such subarrays from those suggested by the mother that the value added to her happiness would be as large as possible. Help her do this!\n\nAlyona can choose any number of the subarrays, even 0 or all suggested by her mother.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of flowers and the number of subarrays suggested by the mother.\n\nThe second line contains the flowers moods\u00a0\u2014 *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (<=-<=100<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nThe next *m* lines contain the description of the subarrays suggested by the mother.

She's fed up with skates and sleds, she was dreaming about Hopscotch all night long. It's a very popular children's game. The game field, the court, looks as is shown in the figure (all blocks are square and are numbered from bottom to top, blocks in the same row are numbered from left to right). Let us describe the hopscotch with numbers that denote the number of squares in the row, staring from the lowest one: 1-1-2-1-2-1-2-(1-2)..., where then the period is repeated (1-2).\n\nThe coordinate system is defined as shown in the figure. Side of all the squares are equal and have length *a*.\n\nMaria is a very smart and clever girl, and she is concerned with quite serious issues: if she throws a stone into a point with coordinates (*x*,<=*y*), then will she hit some square? If the answer is positive, you are also required to determine the number of the square.\n\nIt is believed that the stone has fallen into the square if it is located strictly inside it.

        "prompt": "Title: Colorful Field\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nFox Ciel saw a large field while she was on a bus. The field was a *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* rectangle divided into 1<=\u00d7<=1 cells. Some cells were wasteland, and other each cell contained crop plants: either carrots or kiwis or grapes. \n\nAfter seeing the field carefully, Ciel found that the crop plants of each cell were planted in following procedure:\n -  Assume that the rows are numbered 1 to *n* from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 to *m* from left to right, and a cell in row *i* and column *j* is represented as (*i*,<=*j*). -  First, each field is either cultivated or waste. Crop plants will be planted in the cultivated cells in the order of (1,<=1)<=\u2192<=...<=\u2192<=(1,<=*m*)<=\u2192<=(2,<=1)<=\u2192<=...<=\u2192<=(2,<=*m*)<=\u2192<=...<=\u2192<=(*n*,<=1)<=\u2192<=...<=\u2192<=(*n*,<=*m*). Waste cells will be ignored. -  Crop plants (either carrots or kiwis or grapes) will be planted in each cell one after another cyclically. Carrots will be planted in the first cell, then kiwis in the second one, grapes in the third one, carrots in the forth one, kiwis in the fifth one, and so on. \nThe following figure will show you the example of this procedure. Here, a white square represents a cultivated cell, and a black square represents a waste cell.\n\nNow she is wondering how to determine the crop plants in some certain cells.\n\nInput Specification:\nIn the first line there are four positive integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k*,<=*t* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=4\u00b7104,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=4\u00b7104,<=1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=103,<=1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=103), each of which represents the height of the field, the width of the field, the number of waste cells and the number of queries that ask the kind of crop plants in a certain cell.\n\nFollowing each *k* lines contains two integers *a*,<=*b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=*m*), which denotes a cell (*a*,<=*b*) is waste. It is guaranteed that the same cell will not appear twice in this section.\n\nFollowing each *t* lines contains two integers *i*,<=*j* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*m*), which is a query that asks you the kind of crop plants of a cell (*i*,<=*j*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each query, if the cell is waste, print Waste. Otherwise, print the name of crop plants in the cell: either Carrots or Kiwis or Grapes.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 5 5 6\\n4 3\\n1 3\\n3 3\\n2 5\\n3 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n2 3\\n2 4\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['Waste\\nGrapes\\nCarrots\\nKiwis\\nCarrots\\nCarrots\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe sample corresponds to the figure in the statement.",

        "prompt": "Title: Brain Network (easy)\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne particularly well-known fact about zombies is that they move and think terribly slowly. While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect \u2013 it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated \u2013 it consists of *n* brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly: \n 1.  It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains). 1.  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. \nIf both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead. Your task is to analyze a given nervous system of a zombie and find out whether it is valid.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to *n*) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively. In the next *m* lines, descriptions of brain connectors follow. Every connector is given as a pair of brains *a*\u2002*b* it connects (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*, *a*<=\u2260<=*b*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe output consists of one line, containing either yes or no depending on whether the nervous system is valid.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1\\n4 1\\n', '6 5\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n3 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['no\\n', 'yes\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

He wants to pour these chemicals into a test tube, and he needs to pour them in one by one, in any order. \n\nLet's consider the danger of a test tube. Danger of an empty test tube is 1.

Let's take a look at the following form of such a bar.\n\nA bar is represented as *n* squares, located in line. To add clarity, let's number them with positive integers from 1 to *n* from the left to the right. Each square has saturation (*a**i* for the *i*-th square), which is measured by an integer from 0 to *k*. When the bar for some *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) is displayed, squares 1,<=2,<=... ,<=*i*<=-<=1 has the saturation *k*, squares *i*<=+<=1,<=*i*<=+<=2,<=... ,<=*n* has the saturation 0, and the saturation of the square *i* can have any value from 0 to *k*.\n\nSo some first squares of the progress bar always have the saturation *k*. Some last squares always have the saturation 0. And there is no more than one square that has the saturation different from 0 and *k*.\n\nThe degree of the process's completion is measured in percents. Let the process be *t*% completed.

He loves connecting with other bears via social networks. He has *n* friends and his relation with the *i*-th of them is described by a unique integer *t**i*. The bigger this value is, the better the friendship is. No two friends have the same value *t**i*.\n\nSpring is starting and the Winter sleep is over for bears. Limak has just woken up and logged in. All his friends still sleep and thus none of them is online. Some (maybe all) of them will appear online in the next hours, one at a time.\n\nThe system displays friends who are online. On the screen there is space to display at most *k* friends. If there are more than *k* friends online then the system displays only *k* best of them\u00a0\u2014 those with biggest *t**i*.\n\nYour task is to handle queries of two types:\n -  \"1 id\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend *id* becomes online. It's guaranteed that he wasn't online before. -  \"2 id\"\u00a0\u2014 Check whether friend *id* is displayed by the system.

If *type**i*<==<=1 then a friend *id**i* becomes online. If *type**i*<==<=2 then you should check whether a friend *id**i* is displayed.\n\nIt's guaranteed that no two queries of the first type will have the same *id**i* becuase one friend can't become online twice. Also, it's guaranteed that at least one query will be of the second type (*type**i*<==<=2) so the output won't be empty.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each query of the second type print one line with the answer\u00a0\u2014 \"YES\" (without quotes) if the given friend is displayed and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 2 8\\n300 950 500 200\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n2 3\\n1 1\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n2 2\\n2 3\\n', '6 3 9\\n50 20 51 17 99 24\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n1 5\\n1 2\\n2 4\\n2 2\\n1 1\\n2 4\\n2 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['NO\\nYES\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\n', 'NO\\nYES\\nNO\\nYES\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, Limak has 4 friends who all sleep initially. At first, the system displays nobody because nobody is online. There are the following 8 queries:\n 1.  \"1 3\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 3 becomes online. 1.  \"2 4\"\u00a0\u2014 We should check if friend 4 is displayed. He isn't even online and thus we print \"NO\". 1.  \"2 3\"\u00a0\u2014 We should check if friend 3 is displayed. Right now he is the only friend online and the system displays him. We should print \"YES\". 1.  \"1 1\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 1 becomes online. The system now displays both friend 1 and friend 3. 1.  \"1 2\"\u00a0\u2014 Friend 2 becomes online. There are 3 friends online now but we were given *k*\u2009=\u20092 so only two friends can be displayed.

But, unfortunately, you don't have any microscope nearby, so you can't watch them.\n\nYou know that you have $n$ bacteria in the Petri dish and size of the $i$-th bacteria is $a_i$. Also you know intergalactic positive integer constant $K$.\n\nThe $i$-th bacteria can swallow the $j$-th bacteria if and only if $a_i &gt; a_j$ and $a_i \\le a_j + K$. The $j$-th bacteria disappear, but the $i$-th bacteria doesn't change its size. The bacteria can perform multiple swallows. On each swallow operation any bacteria $i$ can swallow any bacteria $j$ if $a_i &gt; a_j$ and $a_i \\le a_j + K$. The swallow operations go one after another.\n\nFor example, the sequence of bacteria sizes $a=[101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54]$ and $K=1$. The one of possible sequences of swallows is: $[101, 53, 42, 102, \\underline{101}, 55, 54]$ $\\to$ $[101, \\underline{53}, 42, 102, 55, 54]$ $\\to$ $[\\underline{101}, 42, 102, 55, 54]$ $\\to$ $[42, 102, 55, \\underline{54}]$ $\\to$ $[42, 102, 55]$. In total there are $3$ bacteria remained in the Petri dish.\n\nSince you don't have a microscope, you can only guess, what the minimal possible number of bacteria can remain in your Petri dish when you finally will find any microscope.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space separated positive integers $n$ and $K$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\le K \\le 10^6$) \u2014 number of bacteria and intergalactic constant $K$.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$) \u2014 sizes of bacteria you have.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the only integer \u2014 minimal possible number of bacteria can remain.\n\nDemo Input:\n['7 1\\n101 53 42 102 101 55 54\\n', '6 5\\n20 15 10 15 20 25\\n', '7 1000000\\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '1\\n', '7\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe first example is clarified in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second example an optimal possible sequence of swallows is: $[20, 15, 10, 15, \\underline{20}, 25]$ $\\to$ $[20, 15, 10, \\underline{15}, 25]$ $\\to$ $[20, 15, \\underline{10}, 25]$ $\\to$ $[20, \\underline{15}, 25]$ $\\to$ $[\\underline{20}, 25]$ $\\to$ $[25]$.\n\nIn the third example no bacteria can swallow any other bacteria.",

But lately thieves started to sneak into the garden at nights and steal the fruit too often. Vasya can\u2019t spend the nights in the garden and guard the fruit because there\u2019s no house in the garden! Vasya had been saving in for some time and finally he decided to build the house. The rest is simple: he should choose in which part of the garden to build the house. In the evening he sat at his table and drew the garden\u2019s plan. On the plan the garden is represented as a rectangular checkered field *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* in size divided into squares whose side length is 1. In some squares Vasya marked the trees growing there (one shouldn\u2019t plant the trees too close to each other that\u2019s why one square contains no more than one tree). Vasya wants to find a rectangular land lot *a*<=\u00d7<=*b* squares in size to build a house on, at that the land lot border should go along the lines of the grid that separates the squares. All the trees that grow on the building lot will have to be chopped off. Vasya loves his garden very much, so help him choose the building land lot location so that the number of chopped trees would be as little as possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=50) which represent the garden location. The next *n* lines contain *m* numbers 0 or 1, which describe the garden on the scheme. The zero means that a tree doesn\u2019t grow on this square and the 1 means that there is a growing tree. The last line contains two integers *a* and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=50). Note that Vasya can choose for building an *a*<=\u00d7<=*b* rectangle as well a *b*<=\u00d7<=*a* one, i.e. the side of the lot with the length of *a* can be located as parallel to the garden side with the length of *n*, as well as parallel to the garden side with the length of *m*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the minimum number of trees that needs to be chopped off to select a land lot *a*<=\u00d7<=*b* in size to build a house on.

        "prompt": "Title: Steps\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.\n\nVasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The squares have coordinates (*x*,<=*y*) (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m*), where *x* is the index of the row and *y* is the index of the column.\n\nInitially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (*x**c*,<=*y**c*). To play, he has got a list of *k* vectors (*dx**i*,<=*dy**i*) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to *k*, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).\n\nA step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (*x*,<=*y*), and the current vector is (*dx*,<=*dy*), one step moves Vasya to square (*x*<=+<=*dx*,<=*y*<=+<=*dy*). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.\n\nVasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many steps he had made.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the yard's sizes. The second line contains integers *x**c* and *y**c* \u2014 the initial square's coordinates (1<=\u2264<=*x**c*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=1<=\u2264<=*y**c*<=\u2264<=*m*).\n\nThe third line contains an integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of vectors. Then follow *k* lines, each of them contains two integers *dx**i* and *dy**i* (|*dx**i*|,<=|*dy**i*|<=\u2264<=109,<=|*dx*|<=+<=|*dy*|<=\u2265<=1).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the single number \u2014 the number of steps Vasya had made.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++.

        "prompt": "Title: Magical Array\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nValery is very interested in magic. Magic attracts him so much that he sees it everywhere. He explains any strange and weird phenomenon through intervention of supernatural forces. But who would have thought that even in a regular array of numbers Valera manages to see something beautiful and magical.\n\nValera absolutely accidentally got a piece of ancient parchment on which an array of numbers was written. He immediately thought that the numbers in this array were not random. As a result of extensive research Valera worked out a wonderful property that a magical array should have: an array is defined as magic if its minimum and maximum coincide.\n\nHe decided to share this outstanding discovery with you, but he asks you for help in return. Despite the tremendous intelligence and wit, Valera counts very badly and so you will have to complete his work. All you have to do is count the number of magical subarrays of the original array of numbers, written on the parchment. Subarray is defined as non-empty sequence of consecutive elements.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input data contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105). The second line contains an array of original integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (<=-<=109<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint on the single line the answer to the problem: the amount of subarrays, which are magical.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in C++. It is recommended to use cin, cout streams (you can also use the %I64d specificator).\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n2 1 1 4\\n', '5\\n-2 -2 -2 0 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['5\\n', '8\\n']\n\nNote:\nNotes to sample tests:\n\nMagical subarrays are shown with pairs of indices [a;b] of the beginning and the end.\n\nIn the first sample: [1;1], [2;2], [3;3], [4;4], [2;3].\n\nIn the second sample: [1;1], [2;2], [3;3], [4;4], [5;5], [1;2], [2;3], [1;3].",

There also exists Great Gena's code, written in 2016. The problem this code solves is: given the number of tanks that go into the battle from each country, find their product. If it is turns to be too large, then the servers might have not enough time to assign tanks into teams and the whole game will collapse!\n\nThere are exactly *n* distinct countries in the world and the *i*-th country added *a**i* tanks to the game. As the developers of the game are perfectionists, the number of tanks from each country is beautiful. A beautiful number, according to the developers, is such number that its decimal representation consists only of digits '1' and '0', moreover it contains at most one digit '1'. However, due to complaints from players, some number of tanks of one country was removed from the game, hence the number of tanks of this country may not remain beautiful.\n\nYour task is to write the program that solves exactly the same problem in order to verify Gena's code correctness. Just in case.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains the number of countries *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100<=000). The second line contains *n* non-negative integers *a**i* without leading zeroes\u00a0\u2014 the number of tanks of the *i*-th country.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the second line contains at least *n*<=-<=1 beautiful numbers and the total length of all these number's representations doesn't exceed 100<=000.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number without leading zeroes\u00a0\u2014 the product of the number of tanks presented by each country.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n5 10 1\\n', '4\\n1 1 10 11\\n', '5\\n0 3 1 100 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['50', '110', '0']\n\nNote:\nIn sample 1 numbers 10 and 1 are beautiful, number 5 is not not.\n\nIn sample 2 number 11 is not beautiful (contains two '1's), all others are beautiful.\n\nIn sample 3 number 3 is not beautiful, all others are beautiful.",

One of its many weird features is the method of character-based output, known as Turing Tape method. It converts an array of unsigned 8-bit integers into a sequence of characters to print, using the following method.\n\nThe integers of the array are processed one by one, starting from the first. Processing *i*-th element of the array is done in three steps:\n\n1. The 8-bit binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous printed character is reversed. When the first element of the array is processed, the result of this step is considered to be 0.\n\n2. The *i*-th element of the array is subtracted from the result of the previous step modulo 256.\n\n3. The binary notation of the result of the previous step is reversed again to produce ASCII-code of the *i*-th character to be printed.\n\nYou are given the text printed using this method. Restore the array used to produce this text.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input will consist of a single line *text* which contains the message printed using the described method. String *text* will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of *text* will be between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the initial array, which was used to produce *text*, one integer per line.\n\nDemo Input:\n['Hello, World!\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['238\\n108\\n112\\n0\\n64\\n194\\n48\\n26\\n244\\n168\\n24\\n16\\n162\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's have a closer look at the beginning of the example. The first character is \"H\" with ASCII-code 72\u2009=\u200901001000<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>. Its reverse is 00010010<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009=\u200918, and this number should become the result of the second step of processing. The result of the first step is considered to be 0, so the first element of the array has to be (0\u2009-\u200918) mod 256\u2009=\u2009238, where *a* mod *b* is the remainder of division of *a* by *b*.",

        "prompt": "Title: Company Income Growth\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 64 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPetya works as a PR manager for a successful Berland company BerSoft. He needs to prepare a presentation on the company income growth since 2001 (the year of its founding) till now. Petya knows that in 2001 the company income amounted to *a*1 billion bourles, in 2002 \u2014 to *a*2 billion, ..., and in the current (2000<=+<=*n*)-th year \u2014 *a**n* billion bourles. On the base of the information Petya decided to show in his presentation the linear progress history which is in his opinion perfect. According to a graph Petya has already made, in the first year BerSoft company income must amount to 1 billion bourles, in the second year \u2014 2 billion bourles etc., each following year the income increases by 1 billion bourles. Unfortunately, the real numbers are different from the perfect ones. Among the numbers *a**i* can even occur negative ones that are a sign of the company\u2019s losses in some years. That is why Petya wants to ignore some data, in other words, cross some numbers *a**i* from the sequence and leave only some subsequence that has perfect growth.\n\nThus Petya has to choose a sequence of years *y*1, *y*2, ..., *y**k*,so that in the year *y*1 the company income amounted to 1 billion bourles, in the year *y*2 \u2014 2 billion bourles etc., in accordance with the perfect growth dynamics. Help him to choose the longest such sequence.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100). The next line contains *n* integers *a**i* (<=-<=100<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100). The number *a**i* determines the income of BerSoft company in the (2000<=+<=*i*)-th year. The numbers in the line are separated by spaces.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput *k* \u2014 the maximum possible length of a perfect sequence. In the next line output the sequence of years *y*1, *y*2, ..., *y**k*. Separate the numbers by spaces. If the answer is not unique, output any.

Maria Stepanovna wants to rent such three displays with indices $i &lt; j &lt; k$ that the font size increases if you move along the road in a particular direction. Namely, the condition $s_i &lt; s_j &lt; s_k$ should be held.\n\nThe rent cost is for the $i$-th display is $c_i$.

The order number *i* has price *p**i*, direction *d**i* \u2014 buy or sell, and integer *q**i*. This means that the participant is ready to buy or sell *q**i* stocks at price *p**i* for one stock. A value *q**i* is also known as a volume of an order.\n\nAll orders with the same price *p* and direction *d* are merged into one aggregated order with price *p* and direction *d*. The volume of such order is a sum of volumes of the initial orders.\n\nAn order book is a list of aggregated orders, the first part of which contains sell orders sorted by price in descending order, the second contains buy orders also sorted by price in descending order.\n\nAn order book of depth *s* contains *s* best aggregated orders for each direction. A buy order is better if it has higher price and a sell order is better if it has lower price.

Naturally he is facing the problem of choosing a programming language. After long considerations he realized that Java is the best choice. The main argument in favor of choosing Java was that it has a very large integer data type, called BigInteger.\n\nBut having attended several classes of the club, Petya realized that not all tasks require using the BigInteger type. It turned out that in some tasks it is much easier to use small data types. That's why a question arises: \"Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integer *n*?\"\n\nPetya knows only 5 integer types:\n\n1) byte occupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=128 to 127\n\n2) short occupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=32768 to 32767\n\n3) int occupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=2147483648 to 2147483647\n\n4) long occupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from <=-<=9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807\n\n5) BigInteger can store any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and operations with it are much slower.\n\nFor all the types given above the boundary values are included in the value range.\n\nFrom this list, Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can store a positive integer *n*. Since BigInteger works much slower, Peter regards it last. Help him.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a positive number *n*. It consists of no more than 100 digits and doesn't contain any leading zeros. The number *n* can't be represented as an empty string.\n\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the first type from the list \"byte, short, int, long, BigInteger\", that can store the natural number *n*, in accordance with the data given above.\n\nDemo Input:\n['127\\n', '130\\n', '123456789101112131415161718192021222324\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['byte\\n', 'short\\n', 'BigInteger\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

You have to tell her yes if and only if there's at least one scenario (among all 2*n* possible scenarios, 2 possible scenarios for who a traitor in each universe) such that in that scenario the world will end.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 number of universes and number of groups respectively.\n\nThe next *m* lines contain the information about the groups. *i*-th of them first contains an integer *k* (number of times someone joined *i*-th group, *k*<=&gt;<=0) followed by *k* integers *v**i*,<=1,<=*v**i*,<=2,<=...,<=*v**i*,<=*k*. If *v**i*,<=*j* is negative, it means that Rick from universe number <=-<=*v**i*,<=*j* has joined this group and otherwise it means that Morty from universe number *v**i*,<=*j* has joined it.\n\nSum of *k* for all groups does not exceed 104.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn a single line print the answer to Summer's question. Print \"YES\" if she should cancel the event and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 2\\n1 -3\\n4 -2 3 2 -3\\n', '5 2\\n5 3 -2 1 -1 5\\n3 -5 2 5\\n', '7 2\\n3 -1 6 7\\n7 -5 4 2 4 7 -3 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample testcase, 1st group only contains the Rick from universe number 3, so in case he's a traitor, then all members of this group are traitors and so Summer should cancel the event.",

For example, the hard task of Topcoder SRM 595, Constellation, is the probabilistic version of a convex hull.\n\nLet's try to make a new task. Firstly we will use the following task. There are *n* people, sort them by their name. It is just an ordinary sorting problem, but we can make it more interesting by adding nondeterministic element. There are *n* people, each person will use either his/her first name or last name as a handle. Can the lexicographical order of the handles be exactly equal to the given permutation *p*?\n\nMore formally, if we denote the handle of the *i*-th person as *h**i*, then the following condition must hold: .\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of people.\n\nThe next *n* lines each contains two strings.

Each of the friends started from some integral point on the track. Both friends wrote the distance from their start along the track to each of the *n* barriers. Thus, each of them wrote *n* integers in the ascending order, each of them was between 0 and *L*<=-<=1, inclusively.\n\nThere are several tracks in the country, all of them have same length and same number of barriers, but the positions of the barriers can differ among different tracks. Now Dasha is interested if it is possible that Kefa and Sasha ran the same track or they participated on different tracks. \n\nWrite the program which will check that Kefa's and Sasha's tracks coincide (it means that one can be obtained from the other by changing the start position).

Vasya thinks that he has found extra-terrestrial intelligence if there is a system in the way the signals has been received, i.e. if all the intervals between successive signals are equal.

The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40<=000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20<=000 kilometers.\n\nLimak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of *n* parts. In the *i*-th part of his journey, Limak should move *t**i* kilometers in the direction represented by a string *dir**i* that is one of: \"North\", \"South\", \"West\", \"East\".\n\nLimak isn\u2019t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:\n -  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South. -  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North. -  The journey must end on the North Pole. \nCheck if the above conditions are satisfied and print \"YES\" or \"NO\" on a single line.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50).\n\nThe *i*-th of next *n* lines contains an integer *t**i* and a string *dir**i* (1<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=106, )\u00a0\u2014 the length and the direction of the *i*-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint \"YES\" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print \"NO\", both without the quotes.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n7500 South\\n10000 East\\n3500 North\\n4444 West\\n4000 North\\n', '2\\n15000 South\\n4000 East\\n', '5\\n20000 South\\n1000 North\\n1000000 West\\n9000 North\\n10000 North\\n', '3\\n20000 South\\n10 East\\n20000 North\\n', '2\\n1000 North\\n1000 South\\n', '4\\n50 South\\n50 North\\n15000 South\\n15000 North\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n']\n\nNote:\nDrawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples.

Iahub is painting the wall red and Floyd is painting it pink. You can consider the wall being made of a very large number of bricks, numbered 1, 2, 3 and so on. \n\nIahub has the following scheme of painting: he skips *x*<=-<=1 consecutive bricks, then he paints the *x*-th one. That is, he'll paint bricks *x*, 2\u00b7*x*, 3\u00b7*x* and so on red. Similarly, Floyd skips *y*<=-<=1 consecutive bricks, then he paints the *y*-th one. Hence he'll paint bricks *y*, 2\u00b7*y*, 3\u00b7*y* and so on pink.\n\nAfter painting the wall all day, the boys observed that some bricks are painted both red and pink. Iahub has a lucky number *a* and Floyd has a lucky number *b*. Boys wonder how many bricks numbered no less than *a* and no greater than *b* are painted both red and pink.

When the club gathers together, the students behave badly. They've brought lots of shoe laces to the club and got tied with each other. Specifically, each string ties together two students. Besides, if two students are tied, then the lace connects the first student with the second one as well as the second student with the first one.\n\nTo restore order, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for each student Anna finds out what other students he is tied to. If a student is tied to exactly one other student, Anna reprimands him. Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on. And they do so until Anna can reprimand at least one student.\n\nDetermine how many groups of students will be kicked out of the club.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* \u2014 the initial number of students and laces (). The students are numbered from 1 to *n*, and the laces are numbered from 1 to *m*.

It is guaranteed that no two students are tied with more than one lace. No lace ties a student to himself.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the single number \u2014 the number of groups of students that will be kicked out from the club.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1\\n', '6 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n', '6 5\\n1 4\\n2 4\\n3 4\\n5 4\\n6 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0\\n', '2\\n', '1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Anna and Maria won't kick out any group of students \u2014 in the initial position every student is tied to two other students and Anna won't be able to reprimand anyone.\n\nIn the second sample four students are tied in a chain and two more are running by themselves. First Anna and Maria kick out the two students from both ends of the chain (1 and 4), then \u2014 two other students from the chain (2 and 3). At that the students who are running by themselves will stay in the club.\n\nIn the third sample Anna and Maria will momentarily kick out all students except for the fourth one and the process stops at that point.

        "prompt": "Title: Network Topology\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThis problem uses a simplified network topology model, please read the problem statement carefully and use it as a formal document as you develop the solution.\n\nPolycarpus continues working as a system administrator in a large corporation. The computer network of this corporation consists of *n* computers, some of them are connected by a cable. The computers are indexed by integers from 1 to *n*. It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computers\n\nPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.\n\nPolycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.\n\nLet's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture.\n\nYou've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the computer network in Polycarpus' corporation. Help him find out, which topology type the given network is. If that is impossible to do, say that the network's topology is unknown.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (4<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105;\u00a03<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of nodes and edges in the graph, correspondingly. Next *m* lines contain the description of the graph's edges. The *i*-th line contains a space-separated pair of integers *x**i*, *y**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the numbers of nodes that are connected by the *i*-the edge.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is connected. There is at most one edge between any two nodes. No edge connects a node with itself.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn a single line print the network topology name of the given graph. If the answer is the bus, print \"bus topology\" (without the quotes), if the answer is the ring, print \"ring topology\" (without the quotes), if the answer is the star, print \"star topology\" (without the quotes). If no answer fits, print \"unknown topology\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n', '4 4\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n4 1\\n', '4 3\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n', '4 4\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1\\n1 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['bus topology\\n', 'ring topology\\n', 'star topology\\n', 'unknown topology\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

There are *m* bidirectional roads, each of whose connects some pair of cities.\n\nTo bake muffins in her bakery, Masha needs to establish flour supply from some storage. There are only *k* storages, located in different cities numbered *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**k*.\n\nUnforunately the law of the country Masha lives in prohibits opening bakery in any of the cities which has storage located in it. She can open it only in one of another *n*<=-<=*k* cities, and, of course, flour delivery should be paid\u00a0\u2014 for every kilometer of path between storage and bakery Masha should pay 1 ruble.\n\nFormally, Masha will pay *x* roubles, if she will open the bakery in some city *b* (*a**i*<=\u2260<=*b* for every 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*k*) and choose a storage in some city *s* (*s*<==<=*a**j* for some 1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*k*) and *b* and *s* are connected by some path of roads of summary length *x* (if there are more than one path, Masha is able to choose which of them should be used).\n\nMasha is very thrifty and rational. She is interested in a city, where she can open her bakery (and choose one of *k* storages and one of the paths between city with bakery and city with storage) and pay minimum possible amount of rubles for flour delivery.

Once Nikita decided to go with his friend Alex to the Summer Biathlon World Cup. Nikita, as a very important person, received a token which allows to place bets on each section no more than on one competitor.\n\nTo begin with friends learned the rules: in the race there are *n* sections of equal length and *m* participants. The participants numbered from 1 to *m*. About each participant the following is known:\n-  *l**i* \u2014 the number of the starting section, -  *r**i* \u2014 the number of the finishing section (*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*),-  *t**i* \u2014 the time a biathlete needs to complete an section of the path,-  *c**i* \u2014 the profit in roubles. If the *i*-th sportsman wins on one of the sections, the profit will be given to the man who had placed a bet on that sportsman.\nThe *i*-th biathlete passes the sections from *l**i* to *r**i* inclusive. The competitor runs the whole way in (*r**i*<=-<=*l**i*<=+<=1)\u00b7*t**i* time units. It takes him exactly *t**i* time units to pass each section. In case of the athlete's victory on *k* sections the man who has betted on him receives *k*\u00b7*c**i* roubles.\n\nIn each section the winner is determined independently as follows: if there is at least one biathlete running this in this section, then among all of them the winner is the one who has ran this section in minimum time (spent minimum time passing this section). In case of equality of times the athlete with the smaller index number wins. If there are no participants in this section, then the winner in this section in not determined. We have to say that in the summer biathlon all the participants are moving at a constant speed.\n\nWe should also add that Nikita can bet on each section and on any contestant running in this section.\n\nHelp the friends find the maximum possible profit.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=100). Then follow *m* lines, each containing 4 integers *l**i*, *r**i*, *t**i*, *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*t**i*,<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=1000).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer, the maximal profit in roubles that the friends can get.

The only thing that Vasiliy has now is a card from the dining room contaning notes how many times he had a breakfast, a dinner and a supper (thus, the card contains three integers). Vasiliy could sometimes have missed some meal, for example, he could have had a breakfast and a supper, but a dinner, or, probably, at some days he haven't been at the dining room at all.\n\nVasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to sanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper), and the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper). So he considers any of these options. After Vasiliy arrived to the sanatorium, he was there all the time until he left. Please note, that it's possible that Vasiliy left the sanatorium on the same day he arrived.\n\nAccording to the notes in the card, help Vasiliy determine the minimum number of meals in the dining room that he could have missed.

She numbers the stones from 1 to *n*. The cost of the *i*-th stone is *v**i*. Kuriyama Mirai wants to know something about these stones so she will ask you two kinds of questions:\n 1.  She will tell you two numbers, *l* and *r*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*), and you should tell her . 1.  Let *u**i* be the cost of the *i*-th cheapest stone (the cost that will be on the *i*-th place if we arrange all the stone costs in non-decreasing order). This time she will tell you two numbers, *l* and *r*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*l*<=\u2264<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*), and you should tell her . \nFor every question you should give the correct answer, or Kuriyama Mirai will say \"fuyukai desu\" and then become unhappy.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n*\u00a0(1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).

They didn't have any numbers that's why Vasya didn't understand how their denominations differ. He supposed that if one coin is heavier than the other one, then it should be worth more. Vasya weighed all the three pairs of coins on pan balance scales and told you the results. Find out how the deminations of the coins differ or if Vasya has a mistake in the weighting results. No two coins are equal.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input data contains the results of all the weighting, one result on each line. It is guaranteed that every coin pair was weighted exactly once.

For example, if coin \"A\" proved lighter than coin \"B\", the result of the weighting is A&lt;B.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIt the results are contradictory, print Impossible.

There are *n* players playing the game, each player has a card with numbers. The numbers on each card are distinct, but distinct cards can have equal numbers. The card of the *i*-th player contains *m**i* numbers.\n\nDuring the game the host takes numbered balls one by one from a bag. He reads the number aloud in a high and clear voice and then puts the ball away. All participants cross out the number if it occurs on their cards. The person who crosses out all numbers from his card first, wins. If multiple people cross out all numbers from their cards at the same time, there are no winners in the game. At the beginning of the game the bag contains 100 balls numbered 1 through 100, the numbers of all balls are distinct.\n\nYou are given the cards for each player. Write a program that determines whether a player can win the game at the most favorable for him scenario or not.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of the players. Then follow *n* lines, each line describes a player's card.

The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).\n\nLet us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.\n\nNikephoros and Polycarpus have played *n* rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.\n\nNikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items *A*<==<=(*a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**m*), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**m*, *a*1, *a*2, ..., *a**m*, *a*1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items *B*<==<=(*b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**k*).\n\nDetermine the number of red spots on both players after they've played *n* rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109) \u2014 the number of the game's rounds.\n\nThe second line contains sequence *A* as a string of *m* characters and the third line contains sequence *B* as a string of *k* characters (1<=\u2264<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\nDemo Input:\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP\\n', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the game went like this:\n -  R - R. Draw. -  P - S. Nikephoros loses. -  S - P. Polycarpus loses. -  R - P. Nikephoros loses. -  P - R. Polycarpus loses. -  S - S. Draw. -  R - P. Nikephoros loses. \nThus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.",

He can also, having a sequence of *m* points *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**m* with integer coordinates, do the following: denote its initial location by *p*0. First, the robot will move from *p*0 to *p*1 along one of the shortest paths between them (please notice that since the robot moves only along the grid lines, there can be several shortest paths). Then, after it reaches *p*1, it'll move to *p*2, again, choosing one of the shortest ways, then to *p*3, and so on, until he has visited all points in the given order. Some of the points in the sequence may coincide, in that case Robot will visit that point several times according to the sequence order.\n\nWhile Santa was away, someone gave a sequence of points to Robot. This sequence is now lost, but Robot saved the protocol of its unit movements.

        "prompt": "Title: Opposites Attract\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nEverybody knows that opposites attract. That is the key principle of the \"Perfect Matching\" dating agency. The \"Perfect Matching\" matchmakers have classified each registered customer by his interests and assigned to the *i*-th client number *t**i* (<=-<=10<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=10). Of course, one number can be assigned to any number of customers.\n\n\"Perfect Matching\" wants to advertise its services and publish the number of opposite couples, that is, the couples who have opposite values of *t*. Each couple consists of exactly two clients. The customer can be included in a couple an arbitrary number of times. Help the agency and write the program that will find the sought number by the given sequence *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*. For example, if *t*<==<=(1,<=<=-<=1,<=1,<=<=-<=1), then any two elements *t**i* and *t**j* form a couple if *i* and *j* have different parity. Consequently, in this case the sought number equals 4.\n\nOf course, a client can't form a couple with him/herself.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input data contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) which represents the number of registered clients of the \"Couple Matching\". The second line contains a sequence of integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n* (<=-<=10<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=10), *t**i* \u2014 is the parameter of the *i*-th customer that has been assigned to the customer by the result of the analysis of his interests.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the number of couples of customs with opposite *t*. The opposite number for *x* is number <=-<=*x* (0 is opposite to itself). Couples that only differ in the clients' order are considered the same.\n\nNote that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n-3 3 0 0 3\\n', '3\\n0 0 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the couples of opposite clients are: (1,2), (1,5) \u0438 (3,4).\n\nIn the second sample any couple of clients is opposite.",

Princess Heidi has received information about the stars in the nearby solar system from the Rebel spies and now, to help her identify the exact location of the Death Star, she needs to know whether this information is correct. \n\nTwo rebel spies have provided her with the maps of the solar system. Each map is an *N*<=\u00d7<=*N* grid, where each cell is either occupied by a star or empty. To see whether the information is correct, Heidi needs to know whether the two maps are of the same solar system, or if possibly one of the spies is actually an Empire double agent, feeding her false information.\n\nUnfortunately, spies may have accidentally rotated a map by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, or flipped it along the vertical or the horizontal axis, before delivering it to Heidi. If Heidi can rotate or flip the maps so that two of them become identical, then those maps are of the same solar system. Otherwise, there are traitors in the Rebel ranks! Help Heidi find out.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains one number *N* (1<=\u2264<=*N*<=\u2264<=10) \u2013 the dimension of each map.

        "prompt": "Title: Om Nom and Spiders\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOm Nom really likes candies and doesn't like spiders as they frequently steal candies. One day Om Nom fancied a walk in a park. Unfortunately, the park has some spiders and Om Nom doesn't want to see them at all.\n\nThe park can be represented as a rectangular *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* field. The park has *k* spiders, each spider at time 0 is at some cell of the field. The spiders move all the time, and each spider always moves in one of the four directions (left, right, down, up). In a unit of time, a spider crawls from his cell to the side-adjacent cell in the corresponding direction. If there is no cell in the given direction, then the spider leaves the park. The spiders do not interfere with each other as they move. Specifically, one cell can have multiple spiders at the same time.\n\nOm Nom isn't yet sure where to start his walk from but he definitely wants:\n -  to start walking at time 0 at an upper row cell of the field (it is guaranteed that the cells in this row do not contain any spiders); -  to walk by moving down the field towards the lowest row (the walk ends when Om Nom leaves the boundaries of the park). \nWe know that Om Nom moves by jumping. One jump takes one time unit and transports the little monster from his cell to either a side-adjacent cell on the lower row or outside the park boundaries.\n\nEach time Om Nom lands in a cell he sees all the spiders that have come to that cell at this moment of time. Om Nom wants to choose the optimal cell to start the walk from. That's why he wonders: for each possible starting cell, how many spiders will he see during the walk if he starts from this cell? Help him and calculate the required value for each possible starting cell.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*,<=*m*,<=*k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=2000;\u00a00<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*m*(*n*<=-<=1)). \n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains *m* characters \u2014 the description of the park. The characters in the *i*-th line describe the *i*-th row of the park field. If the character in the line equals \".\", that means that the corresponding cell of the field is empty; otherwise, the character in the line will equal one of the four characters: \"L\" (meaning that this cell has a spider at time 0, moving left), \"R\" (a spider moving right), \"U\" (a spider moving up), \"D\" (a spider moving down). \n\nIt is guaranteed that the first row doesn't contain any spiders. It is guaranteed that the description of the field contains no extra characters. It is guaranteed that at time 0 the field contains exactly *k* spiders.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *m* integers: the *j*-th integer must show the number of spiders Om Nom will see if he starts his walk from the *j*-th cell of the first row. The cells in any row of the field are numbered from left to right.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3 4\\n...\\nR.L\\nR.U\\n', '2 2 2\\n..\\nRL\\n', '2 2 2\\n..\\nLR\\n', '3 4 8\\n....\\nRRLL\\nUUUU\\n', '2 2 2\\n..\\nUU\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0 2 2 ', '1 1 ', '0 0 ', '1 3 3 1 ', '0 0 ']\n\nNote:\nConsider the first sample. The notes below show how the spider arrangement changes on the field over time:\n\nCharacter \"*\" represents a cell that contains two spiders at the same time.\n -  If Om Nom starts from the first cell of the first row, he won't see any spiders. -  If he starts from the second cell, he will see two spiders at time 1. -  If he starts from the third cell, he will see two spiders: one at time 1, the other one at time 2.",

He is studying how to use a command line.\n\nPolycarp faced the following problem. There are *n* files in a directory and he needs to delete some of them. Polycarp wants to run a single delete command with filename pattern as an argument. All the files to be deleted should match the pattern and all other files shouldn't match the pattern.\n\nPolycarp doesn't know about an asterisk '*', the only special character he knows is a question mark '?' which matches any single character. All other characters in the pattern match themselves only.\n\nFormally, a pattern matches a filename if and only if they have equal lengths and all characters in the corresponding positions are equal except when the character in the pattern is '?', in which case the corresponding filename character does not matter.\n\nFor example, the filename pattern \"a?ba?\":\n -  matches filenames \"aabaa\", \"abba.\", \"a.ba9\" and \"a.ba.\"; -  does not match filenames \"aaba\", \"abaab\", \"aabaaa\" and \"aabaa.\". \nHelp Polycarp find a pattern which matches files to be deleted and only them or report if there is no such pattern.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the total number of files and the number of files to be deleted.\n\nThe following *n* lines contain filenames, single filename per line.

What is a better way to train than playing a Zuma-like game? \n\nThere are *n* balls put in a row. Each ball is colored in one of *k* colors. Initially the row doesn't contain three or more contiguous balls with the same color. Iahub has a single ball of color *x*. He can insert his ball at any position in the row (probably, between two other balls). If at any moment there are three or more contiguous balls of the same color in the row, they are destroyed immediately. This rule is applied multiple times, until there are no more sets of 3 or more contiguous balls of the same color. \n\nFor example, if Iahub has the row of balls [black, black, white, white, black, black] and a white ball, he can insert the ball between two white balls. Thus three white balls are destroyed, and then four black balls become contiguous, so all four balls are destroyed. The row will not contain any ball in the end, so Iahub can destroy all 6 balls.\n\nIahub wants to destroy as many balls as possible. You are given the description of the row of balls, and the color of Iahub's ball. Help Iahub train for the IOI by telling him the maximum number of balls from the row he can destroy.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains three integers: *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) and *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*k*).

Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted. Note that deleting of the consecutive identical letters can be done in any order, as any order leads to the same result.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input data consists of a single line to be processed. The length of the line is from 1 to 2\u00b7105 characters inclusive. The string contains only lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the given string after it is processed. It is guaranteed that the result will contain at least one character.\n\nDemo Input:\n['hhoowaaaareyyoouu\\n', 'reallazy\\n', 'abacabaabacabaa\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['wre', 'rezy', 'a']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Jumping on Walls\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVasya plays a computer game with ninjas. At this stage Vasya's ninja should get out of a deep canyon.\n\nThe canyon consists of two vertical parallel walls, their height is *n* meters. Let's imagine that we split these walls into 1 meter-long areas and number them with positive integers from 1 to *n* from bottom to top. Some areas are safe and the ninja can climb them. Others are spiky and ninja can't be there. Let's call such areas dangerous.\n\nInitially the ninja is on the lower area of the left wall. He can use each second to perform one of the following actions: \n -  climb one area up; -  climb one area down; -  jump to the opposite wall. That gets the ninja to the area that is exactly *k* meters higher than the area he jumped from. More formally, if before the jump the ninja is located at area *x* of one wall, then after the jump he is located at area *x*<=+<=*k* of the other wall. \nIf at some point of time the ninja tries to get to an area with a number larger than *n*, then we can assume that the ninja got out of the canyon.\n\nThe canyon gets flooded and each second the water level raises one meter. Initially the water level is at the lower border of the first area. Ninja cannot be on the area covered by water. We can assume that the ninja and the water \"move in turns\" \u2014 first the ninja performs some action, then the water raises for one meter, then the ninja performs one more action and so on.\n\nThe level is considered completed if the ninja manages to get out of the canyon.\n\nAfter several failed attempts Vasya started to doubt whether it is possible to complete the level at all. Help him answer the question.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the height of the canyon and the height of ninja's jump, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains the description of the left wall \u2014 a string with the length of *n* characters. The *i*-th character represents the state of the *i*-th wall area: character \"X\" represents a dangerous area and character \"-\" represents a safe area.\n\nThe third line describes the right wall in the same format.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the first area of the left wall is not dangerous.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint \"YES\" (without the quotes) if the ninja can get out from the canyon, otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['7 3\\n---X--X\\n-X--XX-\\n', '6 2\\n--X-X-\\nX--XX-\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the ninja should first jump to the right wall, then go one meter down along the right wall, then jump to the left wall. The next jump can get the ninja from the canyon. \n\nIn the second sample there's no way the ninja can get out of the canyon.",

First, each player chooses an integer in the range from 1 to *n*. Let's assume that Misha chose number *m*, and Andrew chose number *a*.\n\nThen, by using a random generator they choose a random integer *c* in the range between 1 and *n* (any integer from 1 to *n* is chosen with the same probability), after which the winner is the player, whose number was closer to *c*. The boys agreed that if *m* and *a* are located on the same distance from *c*, Misha wins.\n\nAndrew wants to win very much, so he asks you to help him. You know the number selected by Misha, and number *n*. You need to determine which value of *a* Andrew must choose, so that the probability of his victory is the highest possible.\n\nMore formally, you need to find such integer *a* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*n*), that the probability that  is maximal, where *c* is the equiprobably chosen integer from 1 to *n* (inclusive).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the range of numbers in the game, and the number selected by Misha respectively.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 such value *a*, that probability that Andrew wins is the highest. If there are multiple such values, print the minimum of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 1\\n', '4 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2', '2']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample test: Andrew wins if *c* is equal to 2 or 3. The probability that Andrew wins is 2\u2009/\u20093. If Andrew chooses *a*\u2009=\u20093, the probability of winning will be 1\u2009/\u20093. If *a*\u2009=\u20091, the probability of winning is 0.\n\nIn the second sample test: Andrew wins if *c* is equal to 1 and 2. The probability that Andrew wins is 1\u2009/\u20092. For other choices of *a* the probability of winning is less.",

The values $b_j$ for different participants may be different.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible number of days the expedition can last, following the requirements above?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $1 \\le m \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the expedition participants and the number of the daily food packages available.\n\nThe second line contains sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$), where $a_i$ is the type of $i$-th food package.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of days the expedition can last. If it is not possible to plan the expedition for even one day, print 0.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 10\\n1 5 2 1 1 1 2 5 7 2\\n', '100 1\\n1\\n', '2 5\\n5 4 3 2 1\\n', '3 9\\n42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '0\\n', '1\\n', '3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, Natasha can assign type $1$ food to the first participant, the same type $1$ to the second, type $5$ to the third and type $2$ to the fourth. In this case, the expedition can last for $2$ days, since each participant can get two food packages of his food type (there will be used $4$ packages of type $1$, two packages of type $2$ and two packages of type $5$).\n\nIn the second example, there are $100$ participants and only $1$ food package. In this case, the expedition can't last even $1$ day.",

        "prompt": "Title: Exams\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nStudent Valera is an undergraduate student at the University. His end of term exams are approaching and he is to pass exactly *n* exams. Valera is a smart guy, so he will be able to pass any exam he takes on his first try. Besides, he can take several exams on one day, and in any order.\n\nAccording to the schedule, a student can take the exam for the *i*-th subject on the day number *a**i*. However, Valera has made an arrangement with each teacher and the teacher of the *i*-th subject allowed him to take an exam before the schedule time on day *b**i* (*b**i*<=&lt;<=*a**i*). Thus, Valera can take an exam for the *i*-th subject either on day *a**i*, or on day *b**i*. All the teachers put the record of the exam in the student's record book on the day of the actual exam and write down the date of the mark as number *a**i*.\n\nValera believes that it would be rather strange if the entries in the record book did not go in the order of non-decreasing date. Therefore Valera asks you to help him. Find the minimum possible value of the day when Valera can take the final exam if he takes exams so that all the records in his record book go in the order of non-decreasing date.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=5000) \u2014 the number of exams Valera will take.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains two positive space-separated integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=&lt;<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the date of the exam in the schedule and the early date of passing the *i*-th exam, correspondingly.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible number of the day when Valera can take the last exam if he takes all the exams so that all the records in his record book go in the order of non-decreasing date.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n5 2\\n3 1\\n4 2\\n', '3\\n6 1\\n5 2\\n4 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '6\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Valera first takes an exam in the second subject on the first day (the teacher writes down the schedule date that is 3). On the next day he takes an exam in the third subject (the teacher writes down the schedule date, 4), then he takes an exam in the first subject (the teacher writes down the mark with date 5). Thus, Valera takes the last exam on the second day and the dates will go in the non-decreasing order: 3, 4, 5.\n\nIn the second sample Valera first takes an exam in the third subject on the fourth day. Then he takes an exam in the second subject on the fifth day. After that on the sixth day Valera takes an exam in the first subject.",

All of them should be tracked. To do this, there is an inventory number assigned with each item. It is much easier to create a database by using those numbers and keep the track of everything.\n\nDuring an audit, you were surprised to find out that the items are not numbered sequentially, and some items even share the same inventory number! There is an urgent need to fix it. You have chosen to make the numbers of the items sequential, starting with 1. Changing a number is quite a time-consuming process, and you would like to make maximum use of the current numbering.\n\nYou have been given information on current inventory numbers for *n* items in the company. Renumber items so that their inventory numbers form a permutation of numbers from 1 to *n* by changing the number of as few items as possible. Let us remind you that a set of *n* numbers forms a permutation if all the numbers are in the range from 1 to *n*, and no two numbers are equal.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n*\u00a0\u2014 the number of items (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nThe second line contains *n* numbers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the initial inventory numbers of the items.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* numbers\u00a0\u2014 the final inventory numbers of the items in the order they occur in the input.

For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.\n\nThe second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.\n\nThere are *n* users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?\n\nFormally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\"\u00a0\u00a0\"oo\" and \"h\"\u00a0\u00a0\"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.\n\nFor example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:\n -  \"koouper\" and \"kuooper\". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: \"koouper\"  \"kuuper\" and \"kuooper\"  \"kuuper\". -  \"khun\" and \"kkkhoon\". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: \"khun\"  \"khoon\" and \"kkkhoon\"  \"kkhoon\"  \"khoon\". \nFor a given list of words, find the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer number *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=400) \u2014 number of the words in the list.\n\nThe following *n* lines contain words, one word per line. Each word consists of only lowercase Latin letters.

As a best engineer of the company he was assigned a task to develop a printer that will be able to print horizontal and vertical strips. First prototype is already built and Kris wants to tests it. He wants you to implement the program that checks the result of the printing.\n\nPrinter works with a rectangular sheet of paper of size *n*<=\u00d7<=*m*.

He followed the teacher's advice and did as much as *n* measurements, and recorded the results in the notebook. After that he was about to show the results to the teacher, but he remembered that at the last lesson, the teacher had made his friend Petya redo the experiment because the largest and the smallest results differed by more than two times. Vasya is lazy, and he does not want to redo the experiment. He wants to do the task and go home play computer games. So he decided to cheat: before Vasya shows the measurements to the teacher, he will erase some of them, so as to make the largest and the smallest results of the remaining measurements differ in no more than two times. In other words, if the remaining measurements have the smallest result *x*, and the largest result *y*, then the inequality *y*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7*x* must fulfill. Of course, to avoid the teacher's suspicion, Vasya wants to remove as few measurement results as possible from his notes.\n\nHelp Vasya, find what minimum number of measurement results he will have to erase from his notes so that the largest and the smallest of the remaining results of the measurements differed in no more than two times.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of measurements Vasya made.

Today is Tanya's birthday, and her mother decided to spend no more than *m* bourles on the gift to the daughter. Tanya will choose several different types of toys from the new collection as a gift. Of course, she does not want to get a type of toy which she already has.\n\nTanya wants to have as many distinct types of toys in her collection as possible as the result.

In one move, you can apply a single transformation to the matrix: choose an arbitrary element of the matrix and increase it by 1. Each element can be increased an arbitrary number of times.\n\nYou are really curious about prime numbers. Let us remind you that a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two distinct positive integer divisors: itself and number one. For example, numbers 2, 3, 5 are prime and numbers 1, 4, 6 are not. \n\nA matrix is prime if at least one of the two following conditions fulfills:\n -  the matrix has a row with prime numbers only; -  the matrix has a column with prime numbers only; \nYour task is to count the minimum number of moves needed to get a prime matrix from the one you've got.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n*,<=*m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=500) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the matrix, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains *m* integers \u2014 the initial matrix.

Thus, the first row will consist of prime numbers: 2, 2, 3.\n\nIn the second sample you need to increase number 8 in cell (1, 2) three times. Thus, the second column will consist of prime numbers: 11, 2.\n\nIn the third sample you don't have to do anything as the second column already consists of prime numbers: 3, 2.",

The child will follow the algorithm:\n -  If there is some choice whose description at least twice shorter than all other descriptions, or at least twice longer than all other descriptions, then the child thinks the choice is great. -  If there is exactly one great choice then the child chooses it. Otherwise the child chooses C (the child think it is the luckiest choice). \nYou are given a multiple-choice questions, can you predict child's choose?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line starts with \"A.\" (without quotes), then followed the description of choice A. The next three lines contains the descriptions of the other choices in the same format. They are given in order: B, C, D.

        "prompt": "Title: Sonya and Robots\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nSince Sonya is interested in robotics too, she decided to construct robots that will read and recognize numbers.\n\nSonya has drawn $n$ numbers in a row, $a_i$ is located in the $i$-th position. She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.\n\nSonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.\n\nFor example, if the numbers $[1, 5, 4, 1, 3]$ are written, and Sonya gives the number $1$ to the first robot and the number $4$ to the second one, the first robot will stop in the $1$-st position while the second one in the $3$-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number $4$ to the first robot and the number $5$ to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the $3$-rd position while the second one is in the $2$-nd position.\n\nSonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.\n\nSonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs ($p$, $q$), where she will give $p$ to the first robot and $q$ to the second one. Pairs ($p_i$, $q_i$) and ($p_j$, $q_j$) are different if $p_i\\neq p_j$ or $q_i\\neq q_j$.\n\nUnfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch. That is why she is asking you to find the number of pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\leq n\\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of numbers in a row.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers in a row.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one number\u00a0\u2014 the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n1 5 4 1 3\\n', '7\\n1 2 1 1 1 3 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['9\\n', '7\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example, Sonya can give pairs ($1$, $1$), ($1$, $3$), ($1$, $4$), ($1$, $5$), ($4$, $1$), ($4$, $3$), ($5$, $1$), ($5$, $3$), and ($5$, $4$).\n\nIn the second example, Sonya can give pairs ($1$, $1$), ($1$, $2$), ($1$, $3$), ($2$, $1$), ($2$, $2$), ($2$, $3$), and ($3$, $2$).",

It is possible that Vladik's house and the place of the olympiad are located near the same airport. \n\nTo get to the olympiad, Vladik can fly between any pair of airports any number of times, but he has to start his route at the airport *a* and finish it at the airport *b*.\n\nEach airport belongs to one of two companies. The cost of flight from the airport *i* to the airport *j* is zero if both airports belong to the same company, and |*i*<=-<=*j*| if they belong to different companies.\n\nPrint the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *a*, and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=*n*)\u00a0\u2014 the number of airports, the id of the airport from which Vladik starts his route and the id of the airport which he has to reach. \n\nThe second line contains a string with length *n*, which consists only of characters 0 and 1. If the *i*-th character in this string is 0, then *i*-th airport belongs to first company, otherwise it belongs to the second.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 1 4\\n1010\\n', '5 5 2\\n10110\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1', '0']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example Vladik can fly to the airport 2 at first and pay |1\u2009-\u20092|\u2009=\u20091 (because the airports belong to different companies), and then fly from the airport 2 to the airport 4 for free (because the airports belong to the same company). So the cost of the whole flight is equal to 1. It's impossible to get to the olympiad for free, so the answer is equal to 1. \n\nIn the second example Vladik can fly directly from the airport 5 to the airport 2, because they belong to the same company.",

Let us enjoy the splendid view together. How about Friday night? \n\nAt this point the Smart Beaver got rushing. Everything should be perfect by Friday, so he needed to prepare the belt to the upcoming walk. He needed to cut down several trees.\n\nLet's consider the woodland belt as a sequence of trees. Each tree *i* is described by the esthetic appeal *a**i* \u2014 some trees are very esthetically pleasing, others are 'so-so', and some trees are positively ugly!\n\nThe Smart Beaver calculated that he needed the following effects to win the Beaverette's heart: \n -  The first objective is to please the Beaverette: the sum of esthetic appeal of the remaining trees must be maximum possible; -  the second objective is to surprise the Beaverette: the esthetic appeal of the first and the last trees in the resulting belt must be the same; -  and of course, the walk should be successful: there must be at least two trees in the woodland belt left. \nNow help the Smart Beaver! Which trees does he need to cut down to win the Beaverette's heart?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* \u2014 the initial number of trees in the woodland belt, 2<=\u2264<=*n*. The second line contains space-separated integers *a**i* \u2014 the esthetic appeals of each tree. All esthetic appeals do not exceed 109 in their absolute value.\n -  to get 30 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: *n*<=\u2264<=100 (subproblem A1); -  to get 100 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: *n*<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105 (subproblems A1+A2).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print two integers \u2014 the total esthetic appeal of the woodland belt after the Smart Beaver's intervention and the number of the cut down trees *k*.\n\nIn the next line print *k* integers \u2014 the numbers of the trees the Beaver needs to cut down.

Sometimes it leads to interesting problems. \n\nLet's suppose that your task is to build a square city. The world map uses the Cartesian coordinates. The sides of the city should be parallel to coordinate axes. The map contains mines with valuable resources, located at some points with integer coordinates. The sizes of mines are relatively small, i.e. they can be treated as points. The city should be built in such a way that all the mines are inside or on the border of the city square. \n\nBuilding a city takes large amount of money depending on the size of the city, so you have to build the city with the minimum area.

See the output format for better understanding.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first and only line of input contains a single string of form *a*.*deb* where *a*, *d* and *b* are integers and *e* is usual character 'e' (0<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=9,<=0<=\u2264<=*d*<=&lt;<=10100,<=0<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the scientific notation of the desired distance value.\n\n*a* and *b* contain no leading zeros and *d* contains no trailing zeros (but may be equal to 0). Also, *b* can not be non-zero if *a* is zero.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the only real number *x* (the desired distance value) in the only line in its decimal notation. \n\nThus if *x* is an integer, print it's integer value without decimal part and decimal point and without leading zeroes. \n\nOtherwise print *x* in a form of *p*.*q* such that *p* is an integer that have no leading zeroes (but may be equal to zero), and *q* is an integer that have no trailing zeroes (and may not be equal to zero).\n\nDemo Input:\n['8.549e2\\n', '8.549e3\\n', '0.33e0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['854.9\\n', '8549\\n', '0.33\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The place is an infinite plane with introduced Cartesian coordinate system. The meeting table is represented as a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes and whose vertexes are located at the integer points of the plane. At each integer point which belongs to the table perimeter there is a chair in which a general sits.\n\nSome points on the plane contain radiators for the generals not to freeze in winter. Each radiator is characterized by the number *r**i* \u2014 the radius of the area this radiator can heat. That is, if the distance between some general and the given radiator is less than or equal to *r**i*, than the general feels comfortable and warm. Here distance is defined as Euclidean distance, so the distance between points (*x*1,<=*y*1) and (*x*2,<=*y*2) is \n\nEach general who is located outside the radiators' heating area can get sick.

We know that song number *i* has the duration of *t**i* minutes. Eugeny listens to each song, perhaps more than once. He listens to song number *i* *c**i* times. Eugeny's play list is organized as follows: first song number 1 plays *c*1 times, then song number 2 plays *c*2 times, ..., in the end the song number *n* plays *c**n* times.\n\nEugeny took a piece of paper and wrote out *m* moments of time when he liked a song. Now for each such moment he wants to know the number of the song that played at that moment. The moment *x* means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the *x*-th minute of his listening to the play list.\n\nHelp Eugeny and calculate the required numbers of songs.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=105).

It is guaranteed that there isn't such moment of time *v**i*, when the music doesn't play any longer. It is guaranteed that *v**i*<=&lt;<=*v**i*<=+<=1 (*i*<=&lt;<=*m*).\n\nThe moment of time *v**i* means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the *v**i*-th munite from the start of listening to the playlist.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *m* integers \u2014 the *i*-th number must equal the number of the song that was playing during the *v**i*-th minute after Eugeny started listening to the play list.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1 2\\n2 8\\n1 16\\n', '4 9\\n1 2\\n2 1\\n1 1\\n2 2\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n1\\n', '1\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The constraints will guarantee that this is always possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line consists of two integers *n* and *m* .\n\nThen *m* lines follow, each consisting of two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*, *a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*), which means that it is not possible to construct a road connecting cities *a**i* and *b**i*. Consider the cities are numbered from 1 to *n*.\n\nIt is guaranteed that every pair of cities will appear at most once in the input.\n\nOutput Specification:\nYou should print an integer *s*: the minimum number of roads that should be constructed, in the first line. Then *s* lines should follow, each consisting of two integers *a**i* and *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*), which means that a road should be constructed between cities *a**i* and *b**i*.\n\nIf there are several solutions, you may print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 1\\n1 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n1 2\\n4 2\\n2 3\\n']\n\nNote:\nThis is one possible solution of the example: \n\nThese are examples of wrong solutions:",

        "prompt": "Title: Prizes, Prizes, more Prizes\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVasya, like many others, likes to participate in a variety of sweepstakes and lotteries. Now he collects wrappings from a famous chocolate bar \"Jupiter\". According to the sweepstake rules, each wrapping has an integer written on it \u2014 the number of points that the participant adds to his score as he buys the bar. After a participant earns a certain number of points, he can come to the prize distribution center and exchange the points for prizes. When somebody takes a prize, the prize's cost is simply subtracted from the number of his points.\n\nVasya didn't only bought the bars, he also kept a record of how many points each wrapping cost. Also, he remembers that he always stucks to the greedy strategy \u2014 as soon as he could take at least one prize, he went to the prize distribution centre and exchanged the points for prizes. Moreover, if he could choose between multiple prizes, he chose the most expensive one. If after an exchange Vasya had enough points left to get at least one more prize, then he continued to exchange points.\n\nThe sweepstake has the following prizes (the prizes are sorted by increasing of their cost): \n -  a mug (costs *a* points), -  a towel (costs *b* points), -  a bag (costs *c* points), -  a bicycle (costs *d* points), -  a car (costs *e* points). \nNow Vasya wants to recollect what prizes he has received. You know sequence *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*, where *p**i* is the number of points Vasya got for the *i*-th bar. The sequence of points is given in the chronological order. You also know numbers *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*. Your task is to find, how many prizes Vasya received, what prizes they are and how many points he's got left after all operations are completed.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50) \u2014 the number of chocolate bar wrappings that brought points to Vasya. The second line contains space-separated integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=109). The third line contains 5 integers *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=&lt;<=*b*<=&lt;<=*c*<=&lt;<=*d*<=&lt;<=*e*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the prizes' costs.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint on the first line 5 integers, separated by a space \u2014 the number of mugs, towels, bags, bicycles and cars that Vasya has got, respectively. On the second line print a single integer \u2014 the number of points Vasya will have left after all operations of exchange are completed.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n3 10 4\\n2 4 10 15 20\\n', '4\\n10 4 39 2\\n3 5 10 11 12\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 1 1 0 0 \\n1\\n', '3 0 1 0 3 \\n0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Vasya gets 3 points after eating the first chocolate bar. Then he exchanges 2 points and gets a mug. Vasya wins a bag after eating the second chocolate bar. Then he wins a towel after eating the third chocolate bar. After all chocolate bars 3\u2009-\u20092\u2009+\u200910\u2009-\u200910\u2009+\u20094\u2009-\u20094\u2009=\u20091 points remains.",

In the output section below you will see the information about flushing the output.\n\nBear Limak thinks of some hidden number\u00a0\u2014 an integer from interval [2,<=100]. Your task is to say if the hidden number is prime or composite.\n\nInteger *x*<=&gt;<=1 is called prime if it has exactly two distinct divisors, 1 and *x*. If integer *x*<=&gt;<=1 is not prime, it's called composite.\n\nYou can ask up to 20 queries about divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an integer from interval [2,<=100]. The system will answer \"yes\" if your integer is a divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be \"no\".\n\nFor example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer \"yes\" only if you print 2, 7 or 14.\n\nWhen you are done asking queries, print \"prime\" or \"composite\" and terminate your program.\n\nYou will get the Wrong Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not from the range [2,<=100]. Also, you will get the Wrong Answer verdict if the printed answer isn't correct.\n\nYou will get the Idleness Limit Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).\n\nInput Specification:\nAfter each query you should read one string from the input. It will be \"yes\" if the printed integer is a divisor of the hidden number, and \"no\" otherwise.\n\nOutput Specification:\nUp to 20 times you can ask a query\u00a0\u2014 print an integer from interval [2,<=100] in one line. You have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing you should read a response from the input.\n\nIn any moment you can print the answer \"prime\" or \"composite\" (without the quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program.\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line): \n -  fflush(stdout) in C++; -  System.out.flush() in Java; -  stdout.flush() in Python; -  flush(output) in Pascal; -  See the documentation for other languages. \nHacking. To hack someone, as the input you should print the hidden number\u00a0\u2014 one integer from the interval [2,<=100]. Of course, his/her solution won't be able to read the hidden number from the input.\n\nDemo Input:\n['yes\\nno\\nyes\\n', 'no\\nyes\\nno\\nno\\nno\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n80\\n5\\ncomposite\\n', '58\\n59\\n78\\n78\\n2\\nprime\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe hidden number in the first query is 30. In a table below you can see a better form of the provided example of the communication process.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ea790051c34ea7d2761cd9b096412ca7c647a173.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\nThe hidden number is divisible by both 2 and 5. Thus, it must be composite. Note that it isn't necessary to know the exact value of the hidden number. In this test, the hidden number is 30.\n\n<img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/35c6952617fa94ec3e0ea8e63aa1c3c49b3ba420.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>\n\n59 is a divisor of the hidden number. In the interval [2,\u2009100] there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must be 59, which is prime. Note that the answer is known even after the second query and you could print it then and terminate. Though, it isn't forbidden to ask unnecessary queries (unless you exceed the limit of 20 queries).",

        "prompt": "Title: Photographer\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nValera's lifelong ambition was to be a photographer, so he bought a new camera. Every day he got more and more clients asking for photos, and one day Valera needed a program that would determine the maximum number of people he can serve.\n\nThe camera's memory is *d* megabytes. Valera's camera can take photos of high and low quality. One low quality photo takes *a* megabytes of memory, one high quality photo take *b* megabytes of memory. For unknown reasons, each client asks him to make several low quality photos and several high quality photos. More formally, the *i*-th client asks to make *x**i* low quality photos and *y**i* high quality photos.\n\nValera wants to serve as many clients per day as possible, provided that they will be pleased with his work. To please the *i*-th client, Valera needs to give him everything he wants, that is, to make *x**i* low quality photos and *y**i* high quality photos. To make one low quality photo, the camera must have at least *a* megabytes of free memory space. Similarly, to make one high quality photo, the camera must have at least *b* megabytes of free memory space. Initially the camera's memory is empty. Valera also does not delete photos from the camera so that the camera's memory gradually fills up.\n\nCalculate the maximum number of clients Valera can successfully serve and print the numbers of these clients.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *d* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*d*<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the number of clients and the camera memory size, correspondingly. The second line contains two integers *a* and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*<=\u2264<=*b*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the size of one low quality photo and of one high quality photo, correspondingly. \n\nNext *n* lines describe the clients. The *i*-th line contains two integers *x**i* and *y**i* (0<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of low quality photos and high quality photos the *i*-th client wants, correspondingly. \n\nAll numbers on all lines are separated by single spaces.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOn the first line print the answer to the problem \u2014 the maximum number of clients that Valera can successfully serve. Print on the second line the numbers of the client in any order. All numbers must be distinct. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. The clients are numbered starting with 1 in the order in which they are defined in the input data.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 10\\n2 3\\n1 4\\n2 1\\n1 0\\n', '3 6\\n6 6\\n1 1\\n1 0\\n1 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n3 2 ', '1\\n2 ']\n\nNote:\nnone",

Each piece consists of two halves \u2014 the upper one and the lower one. Each of the halves contains a number from 1 to 6. Valera loves even integers very much, so he wants the sum of the numbers on the upper halves and the sum of the numbers on the lower halves to be even.\n\nTo do that, Valera can rotate the dominoes by 180 degrees. After the rotation the upper and the lower halves swap places. This action takes one second. Help Valera find out the minimum time he must spend rotating dominoes to make his wish come true.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), denoting the number of dominoes Valera has. Next *n* lines contain two space-separated integers *x**i*,<=*y**i* (1<=\u2264<=*x**i*,<=*y**i*<=\u2264<=6). Number *x**i* is initially written on the upper half of the *i*-th domino, *y**i* is initially written on the lower half.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 the minimum required number of seconds.

He has learned that for some fouls the players receive yellow cards, and for some fouls they receive red cards. A player who receives the second yellow card automatically receives a red card.\n\nVasya is watching a recorded football match now and makes notes of all the fouls that he would give a card for. Help Vasya determine all the moments in time when players would be given red cards if Vasya were the judge. For each player, Vasya wants to know only the first moment of time when he would receive a red card from Vasya.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains the name of the team playing at home. The second line contains the name of the team playing away. Both lines are not empty. The lengths of both lines do not exceed 20. Each line contains only of large English letters.

The players within one team have distinct numbers. The fouls go chronologically, no two fouls happened at the same minute.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each event when a player received his first red card in a chronological order print a string containing the following information:\n -  The name of the team to which the player belongs; -  the player's number in his team; -  the minute when he received the card. \nIf no player received a card, then you do not need to print anything.\n\nIt is possible case that the program will not print anything to the output (if there were no red cards).\n\nDemo Input:\n['MC\\nCSKA\\n9\\n28 a 3 y\\n62 h 25 y\\n66 h 42 y\\n70 h 25 y\\n77 a 4 y\\n79 a 25 y\\n82 h 42 r\\n89 h 16 y\\n90 a 13 r\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['MC 25 70\\nMC 42 82\\nCSKA 13 90\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

One of his latest inventions is Cheaterius' amulets! They bring luck and wealth, but are rather expensive. Cheaterius makes them himself. The technology of their making is kept secret. But we know that throughout long nights Cheaterius glues together domino pairs with super glue to get squares 2<=\u00d7<=2 which are the Cheaterius' magic amulets! \n\nAfter a hard night Cheaterius made *n* amulets. Everyone of them represents a square 2<=\u00d7<=2, every quarter contains 1 to 6 dots. Now he wants sort them into piles, every pile must contain similar amulets.

        "prompt": "Title: Hard Work\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAfter the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his *n* students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n -  As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. -  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. -  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600 -  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. -  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN -  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. -  I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. -  Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000), the number of students.\n\nNext *n* lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each student write in a different line. Print \"WA\" if his answer is wrong or \"ACC\" if his answer is OK.\n\nDemo Input:\n['Iran_\\nPersian;\\nW_o;n;d;e;r;f;u;l;\\n7\\nWonderfulPersianIran\\nwonderful_PersIAN_IRAN;;_\\nWONDERFUL___IRAN__PERSIAN__;;\\nIra__Persiann__Wonderful\\nWonder;;fulPersian___;I;r;a;n;\\n__________IranPersianWonderful__________\\nPersianIran_is_Wonderful\\n', 'Shapur;;\\nis___\\na_genius\\n3\\nShapur__a_is___geniUs\\nis___shapur___a__Genius;\\nShapur;;is;;a;;geni;;us;;\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['ACC\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\nACC\\nACC\\nWA\\n', 'WA\\nACC\\nACC\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The main feature of these articles is that each of them uses at most two distinct letters. Andrew decided to send an article to the magazine, but as he hasn't written any article, he just decided to take a random one from magazine 26Char. However, before sending it to the magazine 2Char, he needs to adapt the text to the format of the journal. To do so, he removes some words from the chosen article, in such a way that the remaining text can be written using no more than two distinct letters.\n\nSince the payment depends from the number of non-space characters in the article, Andrew wants to keep the words with the maximum total length.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains number *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100)\u00a0\u2014 the number of words in the article chosen by Andrew.

        "prompt": "Title: Pattern\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nDevelopers often face with regular expression patterns. A pattern is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the certain rules.\n\nIn this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For example, string aba matches patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba.\n\nProgrammers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are given *n* patterns of the same length, you need to find a pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect if there is a string that matches both the first and the second pattern. Can you solve this riddle?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of patterns. Next *n* lines contain the patterns.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty and have the same length. The total length of all the patterns does not exceed 105 characters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem \u2014 the pattern with the minimal number of signs '?', which intersects with each of the given ones. If there are several answers, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2\\n?ab\\n??b\\n', '2\\na\\nb\\n', '1\\n?a?b\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['xab\\n', '?\\n', 'cacb\\n']\n\nNote:\nConsider the first example. Pattern xab intersects with each of the given patterns. Pattern ??? also intersects with each of the given patterns, but it contains more question signs, hence it is not an optimal answer. Clearly, xab is the optimal answer, because it doesn't contain any question sign. There are a lot of other optimal answers, for example: aab, bab, cab, dab and so on.",

There is a *n*<=\u00d7<=*n* magic grid on the entrance which is filled with integers. Chris noticed that exactly one of the cells in the grid is empty, and to enter Udayland, they need to fill a positive integer into the empty cell.\n\nChris tried filling in random numbers but it didn't work. ZS the Coder realizes that they need to fill in a positive integer such that the numbers in the grid form a magic square. This means that he has to fill in a positive integer so that the sum of the numbers in each row of the grid (), each column of the grid (), and the two long diagonals of the grid (the main diagonal\u00a0\u2014  and the secondary diagonal\u00a0\u2014 ) are equal. \n\nChris doesn't know what number to fill in. Can you help Chris find the correct positive integer to fill in or determine that it is impossible?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=500)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and columns of the magic grid.\n\n*n* lines follow, each of them contains *n* integers.

If the corresponding cell is empty, *a**i*,<=*j* will be equal to 0. Otherwise, *a**i*,<=*j* is positive.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is exactly one pair of integers *i*,<=*j* (1<=\u2264<=*i*,<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*) such that *a**i*,<=*j*<==<=0.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single integer, the positive integer *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=1018) that should be filled in the empty cell so that the whole grid becomes a magic square.

Company Q conducts a simplified 'Jeopardy!' tournament among the best IT companies. By a lucky coincidence, the old rivals made it to the finals: company R1 and company R2. \n\nThe finals will have *n* questions, *m* of them are auction questions and *n*<=-<=*m* of them are regular questions. Each question has a price. The price of the *i*-th question is *a**i* points. During the game the players chose the questions. At that, if the question is an auction, then the player who chose it can change the price if the number of his current points is strictly larger than the price of the question. The new price of the question cannot be less than the original price and cannot be greater than the current number of points of the player who chose the question. The correct answer brings the player the points equal to the price of the question. The wrong answer to the question reduces the number of the player's points by the value of the question price.\n\nThe game will go as follows. First, the R2 company selects a question, then the questions are chosen by the one who answered the previous question correctly. If no one answered the question, then the person who chose last chooses again.\n\nAll R2 employees support their team.

Everything has its own period, and I think I've figured out this one,\" says Mino with confidence.\n\nDoubtfully, Kanno peeks at Mino's records. \n\nThe records are expressed as a string $s$ of characters '0', '1' and '.', where '0' denotes a low tide, '1' denotes a high tide, and '.' denotes an unknown one (either high or low).\n\nYou are to help Mino determine whether it's possible that after replacing each '.' independently with '0' or '1', a given integer $p$ is not a period of the resulting string. In case the answer is yes, please also show such a replacement to Mino.\n\nIn this problem, a positive integer $p$ is considered a period of string $s$, if for all $1 \\leq i \\leq \\lvert s \\rvert - p$, the $i$-th and $(i + p)$-th characters of $s$ are the same.

Bord, like many other text editors, should be able to print out multipage documents. A user keys a sequence of the document page numbers that he wants to print out (separates them with a comma, without spaces).\n\nYour task is to write a part of the program, responsible for \u00abstandardization\u00bb of this sequence. Your program gets the sequence, keyed by the user, as input. The program should output this sequence in format *l*1-*r*1,*l*2-*r*2,...,*l**k*-*r**k*, where *r**i*<=+<=1<=&lt;<=*l**i*<=+<=1 for all *i* from 1 to *k*<=-<=1, and *l**i*<=\u2264<=*r**i*. The new sequence should contain all the page numbers, keyed by the user, and nothing else. If some page number appears in the input sequence several times, its appearances, starting from the second one, should be ignored. If for some element *i* from the new sequence *l**i*<==<=*r**i*, this element should be output as *l**i*, and not as \u00ab*l**i*<=-<=*l**i*\u00bb.\n\nFor example, sequence 1,2,3,1,1,2,6,6,2 should be output as 1-3,6.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line contains the sequence, keyed by the user. The sequence contains at least one and at most 100 positive integer numbers. It's guaranteed, that this sequence consists of positive integer numbers, not exceeding 1000, separated with a comma, doesn't contain any other characters, apart from digits and commas, can't end with a comma, and the numbers don't contain leading zeroes.

        "prompt": "Title: Shower Line\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nMany students live in a dormitory. A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait. At each moment of time the students talk in pairs: the (2*i*<=-<=1)-th man in the line (for the current moment) talks with the (2*i*)-th one. \n\nLet's look at this process in more detail. Let's number the people from 1 to 5. Let's assume that the line initially looks as 23154 (person number 2 stands at the beginning of the line). Then, before the shower opens, 2 talks with 3, 1 talks with 5, 4 doesn't talk with anyone. Then 2 enters the shower. While 2 has a shower, 3 and 1 talk, 5 and 4 talk too. Then, 3 enters the shower. While 3 has a shower, 1 and 5 talk, 4 doesn't talk to anyone. Then 1 enters the shower and while he is there, 5 and 4 talk. Then 5 enters the shower, and then 4 enters the shower.\n\nWe know that if students *i* and *j* talk, then the *i*-th student's happiness increases by *g**ij* and the *j*-th student's happiness increases by *g**ji*. Your task is to find such initial order of students in the line that the total happiness of all students will be maximum in the end. Please note that some pair of students may have a talk several times. In the example above students 1 and 5 talk while they wait for the shower to open and while 3 has a shower.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input consists of five lines, each line contains five space-separated integers: the *j*-th number in the *i*-th line shows *g**ij* (0<=\u2264<=*g**ij*<=\u2264<=105). It is guaranteed that *g**ii*<==<=0 for all *i*.\n\nAssume that the students are numbered from 1 to 5.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total happiness of the students.\n\nDemo Input:\n['0 0 0 0 9\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n7 0 0 0 0\\n', '0 43 21 18 2\\n3 0 21 11 65\\n5 2 0 1 4\\n54 62 12 0 99\\n87 64 81 33 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['32\\n', '620\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, the optimal arrangement of the line is 23154. In this case, the total happiness equals:",

        "prompt": "Title: Homework\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOnce when Gerald studied in the first year at school, his teacher gave the class the following homework. She offered the students a string consisting of *n* small Latin letters; the task was to learn the way the letters that the string contains are written. However, as Gerald is too lazy, he has no desire whatsoever to learn those letters. That's why he decided to lose some part of the string (not necessarily a connected part). The lost part can consist of any number of segments of any length, at any distance from each other. However, Gerald knows that if he loses more than *k* characters, it will be very suspicious. \n\nFind the least number of distinct characters that can remain in the string after no more than *k* characters are deleted. You also have to find any possible way to delete the characters.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input data line contains a string whose length is equal to *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105). The string consists of lowercase Latin letters. The second line contains the number *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint on the first line the only number *m* \u2014 the least possible number of different characters that could remain in the given string after it loses no more than *k* characters.\n\nPrint on the second line the string that Gerald can get after some characters are lost. The string should have exactly *m* distinct characters. The final string should be the subsequence of the initial string. If Gerald can get several different strings with exactly *m* distinct characters, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['aaaaa\\n4\\n', 'abacaba\\n4\\n', 'abcdefgh\\n10\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\naaaaa\\n', '1\\naaaa\\n', '0\\n\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the string consists of five identical letters but you are only allowed to delete 4 of them so that there was at least one letter left. Thus, the right answer is 1 and any string consisting of characters \"a\" from 1 to 5 in length.\n\nIn the second sample you are allowed to delete 4 characters. You cannot delete all the characters, because the string has length equal to 7. However, you can delete all characters apart from \"a\" (as they are no more than four), which will result in the \"aaaa\" string.\n\nIn the third sample you are given a line whose length is equal to 8, and *k*\u2009=\u200910, so that the whole line can be deleted.

Crucial moment is just around the corner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000.\n\nThis new device is equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of Pineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as possible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial intelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200 years ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on changing the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence.\n\nPineapple insists, that the name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the name of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director decided to replace some characters in AI name with \"#\". As this operation is pretty expensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace with \"#\", such that the name of AI doesn't contain the name of the phone as a substring.\n\nSubstring is a continuous subsequence of a string.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains the name of AI designed by Gogol, its length doesn't exceed 100<=000 characters. Second line contains the name of the phone released by Pineapple 200 years ago, its length doesn't exceed 30. Both string are non-empty and consist of only small English letters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the minimum number of characters that must be replaced with \"#\" in order to obtain that the name of the phone doesn't occur in the name of AI as a substring.\n\nDemo Input:\n['intellect\\ntell\\n', 'google\\napple\\n', 'sirisiri\\nsir\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1', '0', '2']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample AI's name may be replaced with \"int#llect\".\n\nIn the second sample Gogol can just keep things as they are.\n\nIn the third sample one of the new possible names of AI may be \"s#ris#ri\".",

Unary programs are created from Brainfuck programs using the following algorithm. First, replace each command with a corresponding binary code, using the following conversion table: \n -  \"&gt;\" <=\u2192<= 1000, -  \"&lt;\" <=\u2192<= 1001, -  \"+\" <=\u2192<= 1010, -  \"-\" <=\u2192<= 1011, -  \".\" <=\u2192<= 1100, -  \",\" <=\u2192<= 1101, -  \"[\" <=\u2192<= 1110, -  \"]\" <=\u2192<= 1111. \nNext, concatenate the resulting binary codes into one binary number in the same order as in the program. Finally, write this number using unary numeral system \u2014 this is the Unary program equivalent to the original Brainfuck one.\n\nYou are given a Brainfuck program. Your task is to calculate the size of the equivalent Unary program, and print it modulo 1000003 (106<=+<=3).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input will consist of a single line *p* which gives a Brainfuck program. String *p* will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. Each character of *p* will be \"+\", \"-\", \"[\", \"]\", \"&lt;\", \"&gt;\", \".\" or \",\".\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the size of the equivalent Unary program modulo 1000003 (106<=+<=3).\n\nDemo Input:\n[',.\\n', '++++[&gt;,.&lt;-]\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['220\\n', '61425\\n']\n\nNote:\nTo write a number *n* in unary numeral system, one simply has to write 1 *n* times. For example, 5 written in unary system will be 11111.\n\nIn the first example replacing Brainfuck commands with binary code will give us 1101 1100. After we concatenate the codes, we'll get 11011100 in binary system, or 220 in decimal. That's exactly the number of tokens in the equivalent Unary program.",

He has calculated the amount of money that is needed to buy a new skateboard. He left a calculator on the floor and went to ask some money from his parents. Meanwhile his little brother Yusuf came and started to press the keys randomly. Unfortunately Max has forgotten the number which he had calculated. The only thing he knows is that the number is divisible by 4.\n\nYou are given a string *s* consisting of digits (the number on the display of the calculator after Yusuf randomly pressed the keys). Your task is to find the number of substrings which are divisible by 4. A substring can start with a zero.\n\nA substring of a string is a nonempty sequence of consecutive characters.\n\nFor example if string *s* is 124 then we have four substrings that are divisible by 4: 12, 4, 24 and 124. For the string 04 the answer is three: 0, 4, 04.\n\nAs input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line contains string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=3\u00b7105). The string *s* contains only digits from 0 to 9.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint integer *a* \u2014 the number of substrings of the string *s* that are divisible by 4.\n\nNote that the answer can be huge, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.\n\nDemo Input:\n['124\\n', '04\\n', '5810438174\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n', '3\\n', '9\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to *n*. Each edge, namely edge *i*, has a color *c**i*, connecting vertex *a**i* and *b**i*.\n\nMr. Kitayuta wants you to process the following *q* queries.\n\nIn the *i*-th query, he gives you two integers \u2014 *u**i* and *v**i*.\n\nFind the number of the colors that satisfy the following condition: the edges of that color connect vertex *u**i* and vertex *v**i* directly or indirectly.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains space-separated two integers \u2014 *n* and *m* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=100), denoting the number of the vertices and the number of the edges, respectively.\n\nThe next *m* lines contain space-separated three integers \u2014 *a**i*, *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=&lt;<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) and *c**i* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=*m*). Note that there can be multiple edges between two vertices. However, there are no multiple edges of the same color between two vertices, that is, if *i*<=\u2260<=*j*, (*a**i*,<=*b**i*,<=*c**i*)<=\u2260<=(*a**j*,<=*b**j*,<=*c**j*).\n\nThe next line contains a integer \u2014 *q* (1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=100), denoting the number of the queries.\n\nThen follows *q* lines, containing space-separated two integers \u2014 *u**i* and *v**i* (1<=\u2264<=*u**i*,<=*v**i*<=\u2264<=*n*). It is guaranteed that *u**i*<=\u2260<=*v**i*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each query, print the answer in a separate line.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 5\\n1 2 1\\n1 2 2\\n2 3 1\\n2 3 3\\n2 4 3\\n3\\n1 2\\n3 4\\n1 4\\n', '5 7\\n1 5 1\\n2 5 1\\n3 5 1\\n4 5 1\\n1 2 2\\n2 3 2\\n3 4 2\\n5\\n1 5\\n5 1\\n2 5\\n1 5\\n1 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n1\\n0\\n', '1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's consider the first sample. \n -  Vertex 1 and vertex 2 are connected by color 1 and 2. -  Vertex 3 and vertex 4 are connected by color 3. -  Vertex 1 and vertex 4 are not connected by any single color.",

        "prompt": "Title: Growing Mushrooms\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nEach year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\n\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts *t*1 seconds and the second part lasts *t*2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.\n\nAfter the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of *v**i* meters per second. After *t*1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by *k* percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of *u**i* meters per second. After a *t*2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.\n\nBefore the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds *a**i* and *b**i*, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed *a**i* before the break and speed *b**i* after it, or vice versa.\n\nDwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results.\n\nThe participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains four integer numbers *n*, *t*1, *t*2, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=\u2264<=1000;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of participants, the time before the break, the time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth drops during the break, correspondingly.\n\nEach of the following *n* lines contains two integers. The *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) line contains space-separated integers *a**i*, *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the speeds which the participant number *i* chose.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the final results' table: *n* lines, each line should contain the number of the corresponding dwarf and the final maximum height of his mushroom with exactly two digits after the decimal point. The answer will be considered correct if it is absolutely accurate.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 3 3 50\\n2 4\\n4 2\\n', '4 1 1 1\\n544 397\\n280 101\\n280 101\\n693 970\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 15.00\\n2 15.00\\n', '4 1656.07\\n1 937.03\\n2 379.99\\n3 379.99\\n']\n\nNote:\n-  First example: for each contestant it is optimal to use firstly speed 2 and afterwards speed 4, because 2\u00b73\u00b70.5\u2009+\u20094\u00b73\u2009&gt;\u20094\u00b73\u00b70.5\u2009+\u20092\u00b73.",

Let's take one of these buildings. At the moment the defense structure accommodates exactly *n* soldiers. Within this task we can assume that the number of soldiers in the defense structure won't either increase or decrease.\n\nEvery soldier has a rank \u2014 some natural number from 1 to *k*. 1 stands for a private and *k* stands for a general. The higher the rank of the soldier is, the better he fights. Therefore, the player profits from having the soldiers of the highest possible rank.\n\nTo increase the ranks of soldiers they need to train. But the soldiers won't train for free, and each training session requires one golden coin. On each training session all the *n* soldiers are present.\n\nAt the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed. Then, within each of the groups where the soldiers below the rank *k* are present, exactly one soldier increases his rank by one.\n\nYou know the ranks of all *n* soldiers at the moment. Determine the number of golden coins that are needed to increase the ranks of all the soldiers to the rank *k*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100). They represent the number of soldiers and the number of different ranks correspondingly. The second line contains *n* numbers in the non-decreasing order. The *i*-th of them, *a**i*, represents the rank of the *i*-th soldier in the defense building (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*k*).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of golden coins needed to raise all the soldiers to the maximal rank.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 4\\n1 2 2 3\\n', '4 3\\n1 1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4', '5']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example the ranks will be raised in the following manner:\n\n1 2 2 3 \u2009\u2192\u2009 2 2 3 4 \u2009\u2192\u2009 2 3 4 4 \u2009\u2192\u2009 3 4 4 4 \u2009\u2192\u2009 4 4 4 4\n\nThus totals to 4 training sessions that require 4 golden coins.",

        "prompt": "Title: Bear and Compressing\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nLimak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of *q* possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The *i*-th operation is described by a string *a**i* of length two and a string *b**i* of length one. No two of *q* possible operations have the same string *a**i*.\n\nWhen Limak has a string *s* he can perform the *i*-th operation on *s* if the first two letters of *s* match a two-letter string *a**i*. Performing the *i*-th operation removes first two letters of *s* and inserts there a string *b**i*. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string *s* exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any *a**i*.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length *n* and perform *n*<=-<=1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *q* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=6, 1<=\u2264<=*q*<=\u2264<=36)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.\n\nThe next *q* lines describe the possible operations. The *i*-th of them contains two strings *a**i* and *b**i* (|*a**i*|<==<=2,<=|*b**i*|<==<=1). It's guaranteed that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*a**j* for *i*<=\u2260<=*j* and that all *a**i* and *b**i* consist of only first six lowercase English letters.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the number of strings of length *n* that Limak will be able to transform to string \"a\" by applying only operations given in the input.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 5\\nab a\\ncc c\\nca a\\nee c\\nff d\\n', '2 8\\naf e\\ndc d\\ncc f\\nbc b\\nda b\\neb a\\nbb b\\nff c\\n', '6 2\\nbb a\\nba a\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n', '1\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample, we count initial strings of length 3 from which Limak can get a required string \"a\". There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\").

For example, sequences \"[[]][]\", \"[]\" and \"[[][[]]]\" \u2014 are regular, at the same time \"][\", \"[[]\" and \"[[]]][\" \u2014 are irregular. \n\nDraw the given sequence using a minimalistic pseudographics in the strip of the lowest possible height \u2014 use symbols '+', '-' and '|'. For example, the sequence \"[[][]][]\" should be represented as: \n\nEach bracket should be represented with the hepl of one or more symbols '|' (the vertical part) and symbols '+' and '-' as on the example which is given above.\n\nBrackets should be drawn without spaces one by one, only dividing pairs of consecutive pairwise brackets with a single-space bar (so that the two brackets do not visually merge into one symbol). The image should have the minimum possible height. \n\nThe enclosed bracket is always smaller than the surrounding bracket, but each bracket separately strives to maximize the height of the image. So the pair of final brackets in the example above occupies the entire height of the image.\n\nStudy carefully the examples below, they adequately explain the condition of the problem. Pay attention that in this problem the answer (the image) is unique.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an even integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the length of the sequence of brackets.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of brackets \u2014 these are *n* symbols \"[\" and \"]\". It is guaranteed that the given sequence of brackets is regular.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the drawn bracket sequence in the format which is given in the condition.

Then he fell asleep again, and that time he slept till the end of the journey.\n\nAt the station he told his parents about what he was doing, and wrote two sequences of the colours that he had seen before and after his sleep, respectively.\n\nPeter's parents know that their son likes to fantasize. They give you the list of the flags' colours at the stations that the train passes sequentially on the way from A to B, and ask you to find out if Peter could see those sequences on the way from A to B, or from B to A. Remember, please, that Peter had two periods of wakefulness.\n\nPeter's parents put lowercase Latin letters for colours. The same letter stands for the same colour, different letters \u2014 for different colours.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input data contains three lines. The first line contains a non-empty string, whose length does not exceed 105, the string consists of lowercase Latin letters \u2014 the flags' colours at the stations on the way from A to B. On the way from B to A the train passes the same stations, but in reverse order. \n\nThe second line contains the sequence, written by Peter during the first period of wakefulness. The third line contains the sequence, written during the second period of wakefulness. Both sequences are non-empty, consist of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of each does not exceed 100 letters. Each of the sequences is written in chronological order.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput one of the four words without inverted commas: \n -  \u00abforward\u00bb \u2014 if Peter could see such sequences only on the way from A to B; -  \u00abbackward\u00bb \u2014 if Peter could see such sequences on the way from B to A; -  \u00abboth\u00bb \u2014 if Peter could see such sequences both on the way from A to B, and on the way from B to A; -  \u00abfantasy\u00bb \u2014 if Peter could not see such sequences.\n\nDemo Input:\n['atob\\na\\nb\\n', 'aaacaaa\\naca\\naa\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['forward\\n', 'both\\n']\n\nNote:\nIt is assumed that the train moves all the time, so one flag cannot be seen twice. There are no flags at stations A and B.",

        "prompt": "Title: Fortune Telling\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nMarina loves Sasha. But she keeps wondering whether Sasha loves her. Of course, the best way to know it is fortune telling. There are many ways of telling fortune, but Marina has picked the easiest one. She takes in her hand one or several camomiles and tears off the petals one by one. After each petal she pronounces alternatively \"Loves\" and \"Doesn't love\", at that Marina always starts with \"Loves\". There are *n* camomiles growing in the field, possessing the numbers of petals equal to *a*1,<=*a*2,<=... *a**n*. Marina wants to pick a bouquet with the maximal possible total number of petals so that the result would still be \"Loves\". Help her do that; find the maximal number of petals possible in the bouquet.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100), which is the number of flowers growing in the field. The second line contains *n* integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100) which represent the number of petals on a given *i*-th camomile.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number which is the maximal number of petals in the bouquet, the fortune telling on which would result in \"Loves\". If there are no such bouquet, print 0 instead. The bouquet may consist of a single flower.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1\\n1\\n', '1\\n2\\n', '3\\n5 6 7\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '0\\n', '13\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

Having seen this, Vasya got terrified but still tried to restore the collection. He chose several piece pairs and glued each pair together so that each pair formed a lucky ticket. The rest of the pieces Vasya threw away reluctantly. Thus, after the gluing of the 2*t* pieces he ended up with *t* tickets, each of which was lucky.\n\nWhen Leonid tore the tickets in two pieces, one piece contained the first several letters of his number and the second piece contained the rest.\n\nVasya can glue every pair of pieces in any way he likes, but it is important that he gets a lucky ticket in the end. For example, pieces 123 and 99 can be glued in two ways: 12399 and 99123.\n\nWhat maximum number of tickets could Vasya get after that?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the number of pieces. The second line contains *n* space-separated numbers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=108) \u2014 the numbers on the pieces. Vasya can only glue the pieces in pairs. Even if the number of a piece is already lucky, Vasya should glue the piece with some other one for it to count as lucky. Vasya does not have to use all the pieces. The numbers on the pieces an on the resulting tickets may coincide.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the single number \u2014 the maximum number of lucky tickets that will be able to be restored. Don't forget that every lucky ticket is made of exactly two pieces glued together.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n123 123 99\\n', '6\\n1 1 1 23 10 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '1\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

Let's consider the following simple design of a level.\n\nA dungeon consists of *n* segments located at a same vertical level, each segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. \n\nOne of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform number *i*1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platforms *i*1<=&lt;<=*i*2<=&lt;<=...<=&lt;<=*i**k*, if *i*2<=-<=*i*1<==<=*i*3<=-<=*i*2<==<=...<==<=*i**k*<=-<=*i**k*<=-<=1. Of course, all segments *i*1,<=*i*2,<=... *i**k* should be exactly the platforms, not pits. \n\nLet's call a level to be good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence *i*1,<=*i*2,<=...,<=*i*5, consisting of five platforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Given the scheme of the level, check if it is good.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of segments on the level.\n\nNext line contains the scheme of the level represented as a string of *n* characters '*' and '.'.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the level is good, print the word \"yes\" (without the quotes), otherwise print the word \"no\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['16\\n.**.*..*.***.**.\\n', '11\\n.*.*...*.*.\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['yes', 'no']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample test you may perform a sequence of jumps through platforms 2,\u20095,\u20098,\u200911,\u200914.",

Alyona can repeat this operation as many times as she wants.

Misha had. And this time he has a really strong excuse: he faced a space-time paradox! Space and time replaced each other.\n\nThe entire universe turned into an enormous clock face with three hands\u00a0\u2014 hour, minute, and second. Time froze, and clocks now show the time *h* hours, *m* minutes, *s* seconds.\n\nLast time Misha talked with the coordinator at *t*1 o'clock, so now he stands on the number *t*1 on the clock face. The contest should be ready by *t*2 o'clock. In the terms of paradox it means that Misha has to go to number *t*2 somehow. Note that he doesn't have to move forward only: in these circumstances time has no direction.\n\nClock hands are very long, and Misha cannot get round them. He also cannot step over as it leads to the collapse of space-time. That is, if hour clock points 12 and Misha stands at 11 then he cannot move to 1 along the top arc. He has to follow all the way round the clock center (of course, if there are no other hands on his way).\n\nGiven the hands' positions, *t*1, and *t*2, find if Misha can prepare the contest on time (or should we say on space?). That is, find if he can move from *t*1 to *t*2 by the clock face.\n\nInput Specification:\nFive integers *h*, *m*, *s*, *t*1, *t*2 (1<=\u2264<=*h*<=\u2264<=12, 0<=\u2264<=*m*,<=*s*<=\u2264<=59, 1<=\u2264<=*t*1,<=*t*2<=\u2264<=12, *t*1<=\u2260<=*t*2).\n\nMisha's position and the target time do not coincide with the position of any hand.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint \"YES\" (quotes for clarity), if Misha can prepare the contest on time, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can print each character either upper- or lowercase (\"YeS\" and \"yes\" are valid when the answer is \"YES\").\n\nDemo Input:\n['12 30 45 3 11\\n', '12 0 1 12 1\\n', '3 47 0 4 9\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['NO\\n', 'YES\\n', 'YES\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe three examples are shown on the pictures below from left to right. The starting position of Misha is shown with green, the ending position is shown with pink.

They decided to start with the name.\n\nFor this purpose the corporation has consecutively hired *m* designers. Once a company hires the *i*-th designer, he immediately contributes to the creation of a new corporation name as follows: he takes the newest version of the name and replaces all the letters *x**i* by *y**i*, and all the letters *y**i* by *x**i*. This results in the new version. It is possible that some of these letters do no occur in the string. It may also happen that *x**i* coincides with *y**i*. The version of the name received after the work of the last designer becomes the new name of the corporation.\n\nManager Arkady has recently got a job in this company, but is already soaked in the spirit of teamwork and is very worried about the success of the rebranding.

He takes some integer number $x$, writes it down on the board, and then performs with it $n - 1$ operations of the two kinds: \n -  divide the number $x$ by $3$ ($x$ must be divisible by $3$); -  multiply the number $x$ by $2$. \nAfter each operation, Polycarp writes down the result on the board and replaces $x$ by the result. So there will be $n$ numbers on the board after all.\n\nYou are given a sequence of length $n$ \u2014 the numbers that Polycarp wrote down. This sequence is given in arbitrary order, i.e. the order of the sequence can mismatch the order of the numbers written on the board.\n\nYour problem is to rearrange (reorder) elements of this sequence in such a way that it can match possible Polycarp's game in the order of the numbers written on the board.

The book had *n* names of her friends and unusually enough, each name was exactly *m* letters long. Let's number the names from 1 to *n* in the order in which they are written.\n\nAs mom wasn't home, Vasya decided to play with names: he chose three integers *i*, *j*, *k* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*m*), then he took names number *i* and *j* and swapped their prefixes of length *k*. For example, if we take names \"CBDAD\" and \"AABRD\" and swap their prefixes with the length of 3, the result will be names \"AABAD\" and \"CBDRD\".\n\nYou wonder how many different names Vasya can write instead of name number 1, if Vasya is allowed to perform any number of the described actions. As Vasya performs each action, he chooses numbers *i*, *j*, *k* independently from the previous moves and his choice is based entirely on his will.

Then they play a \"war\"-like card game. \n\nThe rules are following. On each turn a fight happens. Each of them picks card from the top of his stack and puts on the table. The one whose card value is bigger wins this fight and takes both cards from the table to the bottom of his stack. More precisely, he first takes his opponent's card and puts to the bottom of his stack, and then he puts his card to the bottom of his stack. If after some turn one of the player's stack becomes empty, he loses and the other one wins. \n\nYou have to calculate how many fights will happen and who will win the game, or state that game won't end.\n\nInput Specification:\nFirst line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10), the number of cards.\n\nSecond line contains integer *k*1 (1<=\u2264<=*k*1<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1), the number of the first soldier's cards. Then follow *k*1 integers that are the values on the first soldier's cards, from top to bottom of his stack.\n\nThird line contains integer *k*2 (*k*1<=+<=*k*2<==<=*n*), the number of the second soldier's cards. Then follow *k*2 integers that are the values on the second soldier's cards, from top to bottom of his stack.\n\nAll card values are different.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf somebody wins in this game, print 2 integers where the first one stands for the number of fights before end of game and the second one is 1 or 2 showing which player has won.\n\nIf the game won't end and will continue forever output <=-<=1.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n2 1 3\\n2 4 2\\n', '3\\n1 2\\n2 1 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['6 2', '-1']\n\nNote:\nFirst sample: \n\nSecond sample:",

        "prompt": "Title: Megacity\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe administration of the Tomsk Region firmly believes that it's time to become a megacity (that is, get population of one million). Instead of improving the demographic situation, they decided to achieve its goal by expanding the boundaries of the city.\n\nThe city of Tomsk can be represented as point on the plane with coordinates (0; 0). The city is surrounded with *n* other locations, the *i*-th one has coordinates (*x**i*, *y**i*) with the population of *k**i* people. You can widen the city boundaries to a circle of radius *r*. In such case all locations inside the circle and on its border are included into the city.\n\nYour goal is to write a program that will determine the minimum radius *r*, to which is necessary to expand the boundaries of Tomsk, so that it becomes a megacity.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *s* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=103; 1<=\u2264<=*s*<=&lt;<=106) \u2014 the number of locatons around Tomsk city and the population of the city. Then *n* lines follow. The *i*-th line contains three integers \u2014 the *x**i* and *y**i* coordinate values of the *i*-th location and the number *k**i* of people in it (1<=\u2264<=*k**i*<=&lt;<=106). Each coordinate is an integer and doesn't exceed 104 in its absolute value.\n\nIt is guaranteed that no two locations are at the same point and no location is at point (0;\u00a00).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the output, print \"-1\" (without the quotes), if Tomsk won't be able to become a megacity. Otherwise, in the first line print a single real number \u2014 the minimum radius of the circle that the city needs to expand to in order to become a megacity.\n\nThe answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error don't exceed 10<=-<=6.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 999998\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 1\\n3 3 1\\n2 -2 1\\n', '4 999998\\n1 1 2\\n2 2 1\\n3 3 1\\n2 -2 1\\n', '2 1\\n1 1 999997\\n2 2 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2.8284271\\n', '1.4142136\\n', '-1']\n\nNote:\nnone",

When Liss occupies the interval [*k*<=-<=*d*,<=*k*<=+<=*d*] and a stone falls to *k*, she will escape to the left or to the right. If she escapes to the left, her new interval will be [*k*<=-<=*d*,<=*k*]. If she escapes to the right, her new interval will be [*k*,<=*k*<=+<=*d*].\n\nYou are given a string *s* of length *n*.

After that all the resulting parts of the banner will be glued into a single piece (if the beginning or the end of the original banner was cut out, only one part remains); it is not allowed change the relative order of parts of the banner (i.e. after a substring is cut, several first and last letters are left, it is allowed only to glue the last letters to the right of the first letters). Thus, for example, for example, you can cut a substring out from string 'TEMPLATE' and get string 'TEMPLE' (if you cut out string AT), 'PLATE' (if you cut out TEM), 'T' (if you cut out EMPLATE), etc.\n\nHelp the organizers of the round determine whether it is possible to cut out of the banner some substring in such a way that the remaining parts formed word CODEFORCES.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line of the input contains the word written on the banner. The word only consists of upper-case English letters. The word is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed 100 characters. It is guaranteed that the word isn't word CODEFORCES.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint 'YES', if there exists a way to cut out the substring, and 'NO' otherwise (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['CODEWAITFORITFORCES\\n', 'BOTTOMCODER\\n', 'DECODEFORCES\\n', 'DOGEFORCES\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n', 'YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The cows, labeled 1 through *n*, are arranged so that the *i*-th cow occupies the *i*-th stall from the left. However, Elsie, after realizing that she will forever live in the shadows beyond Bessie's limelight, has formed the Mischievous Mess Makers and is plotting to disrupt this beautiful pastoral rhythm. While Farmer John takes his *k* minute long nap, Elsie and the Mess Makers plan to repeatedly choose two distinct stalls and swap the cows occupying those stalls, making no more than one swap each minute.\n\nBeing the meticulous pranksters that they are, the Mischievous Mess Makers would like to know the maximum messiness attainable in the *k* minutes that they have.

        "prompt": "Title: Trading Business\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nTo get money for a new aeonic blaster, ranger Qwerty decided to engage in trade for a while. He wants to buy some number of items (or probably not to buy anything at all) on one of the planets, and then sell the bought items on another planet. Note that this operation is not repeated, that is, the buying and the selling are made only once. To carry out his plan, Qwerty is going to take a bank loan that covers all expenses and to return the loaned money at the end of the operation (the money is returned without the interest). At the same time, Querty wants to get as much profit as possible.\n\nThe system has *n* planets in total. On each of them Qwerty can buy or sell items of *m* types (such as food, medicine, weapons, alcohol, and so on). For each planet *i* and each type of items *j* Qwerty knows the following:\n-  *a**ij* \u2014 the cost of buying an item; -  *b**ij* \u2014 the cost of selling an item; -  *c**ij* \u2014 the number of remaining items.\nIt is not allowed to buy more than *c**ij* items of type *j* on planet *i*, but it is allowed to sell any number of items of any kind.\n\nKnowing that the hold of Qwerty's ship has room for no more than *k* items, determine the maximum profit which Qwerty can get.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers *n*, *m* and *k* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=10, 1<=\u2264<=*m*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of planets, the number of question types and the capacity of Qwerty's ship hold, correspondingly.\n\nThen follow *n* blocks describing each planet.\n\nThe first line of the *i*-th block has the planet's name as a string with length from 1 to 10 Latin letters. The first letter of the name is uppercase, the rest are lowercase. Then in the *i*-th block follow *m* lines, the *j*-th of them contains three integers *a**ij*, *b**ij* and *c**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*b**ij*<=&lt;<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=1000, 0<=\u2264<=*c**ij*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the numbers that describe money operations with the *j*-th item on the *i*-th planet. The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the names of all planets are different.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 the maximum profit Qwerty can get.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 3 10\\nVenus\\n6 5 3\\n7 6 5\\n8 6 10\\nEarth\\n10 9 0\\n8 6 4\\n10 9 3\\nMars\\n4 3 0\\n8 4 12\\n7 2 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['16']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test case you should fly to planet Venus, take a loan on 74 units of money and buy three items of the first type and 7 items of the third type (3\u00b76\u2009+\u20097\u00b78\u2009=\u200974). Then the ranger should fly to planet Earth and sell there all the items he has bought. He gets 3\u00b79\u2009+\u20097\u00b79\u2009=\u200990 units of money for the items, he should give 74 of them for the loan. The resulting profit equals 16 units of money. We cannot get more profit in this case.",

If there are less than *k* centimeters remaining, than during this second processor smashes all the remaining potato.\n\nVanya has *n* pieces of potato, the height of the *i*-th piece is equal to *a**i*. He puts them in the food processor one by one starting from the piece number 1 and finishing with piece number *n*. Formally, each second the following happens:\n 1.  If there is at least one piece of potato remaining, Vanya puts them in the processor one by one, until there is not enough space for the next piece. 1.

At the end of the second there is amount of height 3 remaining. 1.  Vanya puts the piece of height 3 inside and again there are only 3 centimeters remaining at the end of this second. 1.  Vanya finally puts the pieces of height 2 and 1 inside. At the end of the second the height of potato in the processor is equal to 3. 1.  During this second processor finally smashes all the remaining potato and the process finishes. \nIn the second sample, Vanya puts the piece of height 5 inside and waits for 2 seconds while it is completely smashed. Then he repeats the same process for 4 other pieces. The total time is equal to 2\u00b75\u2009=\u200910 seconds.\n\nIn the third sample, Vanya simply puts all the potato inside the processor and waits 2 seconds.",

Now an exam on Mathematical Analysis is approaching and something has to be done asap (that is, quickly). Let's number the students of the group from 1 to *n*. Each student *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) has a best friend *p*[*i*] (1<=\u2264<=*p*[*i*]<=\u2264<=*n*). In fact, each student is a best friend of exactly one student. In other words, all *p*[*i*] are different. It is possible that the group also has some really \"special individuals\" for who *i*<==<=*p*[*i*].\n\nEach student wrote exactly one notebook of lecture notes. We know that the students agreed to act by the following algorithm: \n -  on the first day of revising each student studies his own Mathematical Analysis notes, -  in the morning of each following day each student gives the notebook to his best friend and takes a notebook from the student who calls him the best friend. \nThus, on the second day the student *p*[*i*] (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) studies the *i*-th student's notes, on the third day the notes go to student *p*[*p*[*i*]] and so on. Due to some characteristics of the boys' friendship (see paragraph 1), each day each student has exactly one notebook to study.\n\nYou are given two sequences that describe the situation on the third and fourth days of revising:\n -  *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, where *a**i* means the student who gets the *i*-th student's notebook on the third day of revising; -  *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n*, where *b**i* means the student who gets the *i*-th student's notebook on the fourth day of revising. \nYou do not know array *p*, that is you do not know who is the best friend to who. Write a program that finds *p* by the given sequences *a* and *b*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of students in the group. The second line contains sequence of different integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*).

She has already created a message \u2014 string *s* of length *n*, consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters. Tanya can't write yet, so she found a newspaper and decided to cut out the letters and glue them into the postcard to achieve string *s*. The newspaper contains string *t*, consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters. We know that the length of string *t* greater or equal to the length of the string *s*.\n\nThe newspaper may possibly have too few of some letters needed to make the text and too many of some other letters. That's why Tanya wants to cut some *n* letters out of the newspaper and make a message of length exactly *n*, so that it looked as much as possible like *s*. If the letter in some position has correct value and correct letter case (in the string *s* and in the string that Tanya will make), then she shouts joyfully \"YAY!\", and if the letter in the given position has only the correct value but it is in the wrong case, then the girl says \"WHOOPS\".\n\nTanya wants to make such message that lets her shout \"YAY!\" as much as possible. If there are multiple ways to do this, then her second priority is to maximize the number of times she says \"WHOOPS\". Your task is to help Tanya make the message.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains line *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105), consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters \u2014 the text of Tanya's message.\n\nThe second line contains line *t* (|*s*|<=\u2264<=|*t*|<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105), consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters \u2014 the text written in the newspaper.\n\nHere |*a*| means the length of the string *a*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint two integers separated by a space:\n -  the first number is the number of times Tanya shouts \"YAY!\" while making the message, -  the second number is the number of times Tanya says \"WHOOPS\" while making the message.\n\nDemo Input:\n['AbC\\nDCbA\\n', 'ABC\\nabc\\n', 'abacaba\\nAbaCaBA\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3 0\\n', '0 3\\n', '3 4\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

You can choose some experience in real life, formalize it and then you will get a new task.\n\nLet's think about a scene in real life: there are lots of people waiting in front of the elevator, each person wants to go to a certain floor. We can formalize it in the following way. We have *n* people standing on the first floor, the *i*-th person wants to go to the *f**i*-th floor. Unfortunately, there is only one elevator and its capacity equal to *k* (that is at most *k* people can use it simultaneously). Initially the elevator is located on the first floor. The elevator needs |*a*<=-<=*b*| seconds to move from the *a*-th floor to the *b*-th floor (we don't count the time the people need to get on and off the elevator).\n\nWhat is the minimal number of seconds that is needed to transport all the people to the corresponding floors and then return the elevator to the first floor?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=2000) \u2014 the number of people and the maximal capacity of the elevator.\n\nThe next line contains *n* integers: *f*1,<=*f*2,<=...,<=*f**n* (2<=\u2264<=*f**i*<=\u2264<=2000), where *f**i* denotes the target floor of the *i*-th person.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the minimal time needed to achieve the goal.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\n2 3 4\\n', '4 2\\n50 100 50 100\\n', '10 3\\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['8\\n', '296\\n', '8\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn first sample, an optimal solution is: \n 1.  The elevator takes up person #1 and person #2. 1.  It goes to the 2nd floor. 1.  Both people go out of the elevator. 1.  The elevator goes back to the 1st floor. 1.  Then the elevator takes up person #3. 1.  And it goes to the 2nd floor. 1.  It picks up person #2. 1.  Then it goes to the 3rd floor. 1.  Person #2 goes out. 1.  Then it goes to the 4th floor, where person #3 goes out. 1.  The elevator goes back to the 1st floor.",

After classes, he went into the office to wash the board, and found on it the number *n*. He asked what is this number and the teacher of mathematics Inna Petrovna answered Vova that *n* is the answer to the arithmetic task for first-graders. In the textbook, a certain positive integer *x* was given. The task was to add *x* to the sum of the digits of the number *x* written in decimal numeral system.\n\nSince the number *n* on the board was small, Vova quickly guessed which *x* could be in the textbook. Now he wants to get a program which will search for arbitrary values of the number *n* for all suitable values of *x* or determine that such *x* does not exist. Write such a program for Vova.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print one integer *k*\u00a0\u2014 number of different values of *x* satisfying the condition. \n\nIn next *k* lines print these values in ascending order.\n\nDemo Input:\n['21\\n', '20\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n15\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test case *x*\u2009=\u200915 there is only one variant: 15\u2009+\u20091\u2009+\u20095\u2009=\u200921.\n\nIn the second test case there are no such *x*.",

Note that their sum is a power of two. Similarly, such an element can be found for $a_2$ and $a_3$), -  $[1, 1, 1, 1023]$, -  $[7, 39, 89, 25, 89]$, -  $[]$. \nNote that, by definition, an empty sequence (with a length of $0$) is good.\n\nFor example, the following sequences are not good:\n -  $[16]$ (for $a_1=16$, it is impossible to find another element $a_j$ such that their sum is a power of two), -  $[4, 16]$ (for $a_1=4$, it is impossible to find another element $a_j$ such that their sum is a power of two), -  $[1, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8]$ (for $a_3=2$, it is impossible to find another element $a_j$ such that their sum is a power of two). \nYou are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$.

We're going to give you the answer, and you need to print a test case that produces the given answer. The original problem is in the following paragraph.\n\nPeople don't use cash as often as they used to. Having a credit card solves some of the hassles of cash, such as having to receive change when you can't form the exact amount of money needed to purchase an item. Typically cashiers will give you as few coins as possible in change, but they don't have to. For example, if your change is 30 cents, a cashier could give you a 5 cent piece and a 25 cent piece, or they could give you three 10 cent pieces, or ten 1 cent pieces, two 5 cent pieces, and one 10 cent piece. Altogether there are 18 different ways to make 30 cents using only 1 cent pieces, 5 cent pieces, 10 cent pieces, and 25 cent pieces. Two ways are considered different if they contain a different number of at least one type of coin. Given the denominations of the coins and an amount of change to be made, how many different ways are there to make change?\n\nAs we mentioned before, we lost all the test cases for this problem, so we're actually going to give you the number of ways, and want you to produce a test case for which the number of ways is the given number.

It's boring for them to play usual tic-tac-toe game, so they are a playing modified version of this game. Here are its rules.\n\nThe game is played on the following field.\n\nPlayers are making moves by turns. At first move a player can put his chip in any cell of any small field. For following moves, there are some restrictions: if during last move the opposite player put his chip to cell with coordinates (*x**l*,<=*y**l*) in some small field, the next move should be done in one of the cells of the small field with coordinates (*x**l*,<=*y**l*). For example, if in the first move a player puts his chip to lower left cell of central field, then the second player on his next move should put his chip into some cell of lower left field (pay attention to the first test case). If there are no free cells in the required field, the player can put his chip to any empty cell on any field.\n\nYou are given current state of the game and coordinates of cell in which the last move was done. You should find all cells in which the current player can put his chip.\n\nA hare works as a postman in the forest, he likes to foul bears. Sometimes he changes the game field a bit, so the current state of the game could be unreachable. However, after his changes the cell where the last move was done is not empty. You don't need to find if the state is unreachable or not, just output possible next moves according to the rules.\n\nInput Specification:\nFirst 11 lines contains descriptions of table with 9 rows and 9 columns which are divided into 9 small fields by spaces and empty lines. Each small field is described by 9 characters without spaces and empty lines. character \"x\" (ASCII-code 120) means that the cell is occupied with chip of the first player, character \"o\" (ASCII-code 111) denotes a field occupied with chip of the second player, character \".\" (ASCII-code 46) describes empty cell.\n\nThe line after the table contains two integers *x* and *y* (1<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=\u2264<=9). They describe coordinates of the cell in table where the last move was done. Rows in the table are numbered from up to down and columns are numbered from left to right.\n\nIt's guaranteed that cell where the last move was done is filled with \"x\" or \"o\". Also, it's guaranteed that there is at least one empty cell. It's not guaranteed that current state of game is reachable.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput the field in same format with characters \"!\" (ASCII-code 33) on positions where the current player can put his chip.

        "prompt": "Title: Game of Credit Cards\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAfter the fourth season Sherlock and Moriary have realized the whole foolishness of the battle between them and decided to continue their competitions in peaceful game of Credit Cards.\n\nRules of this game are simple: each player bring his favourite *n*-digit credit card. Then both players name the digits written on their cards one by one. If two digits are not equal, then the player, whose digit is smaller gets a flick (knock in the forehead usually made with a forefinger) from the other player. For example, if *n*<==<=3, Sherlock's card is 123 and Moriarty's card has number 321, first Sherlock names 1 and Moriarty names 3 so Sherlock gets a flick. Then they both digit 2 so no one gets a flick. Finally, Sherlock names 3, while Moriarty names 1 and gets a flick.\n\nOf course, Sherlock will play honestly naming digits one by one in the order they are given, while Moriary, as a true villain, plans to cheat. He is going to name his digits in some other order (however, he is not going to change the overall number of occurences of each digit). For example, in case above Moriarty could name 1, 2, 3 and get no flicks at all, or he can name 2, 3 and 1 to give Sherlock two flicks.\n\nYour goal is to find out the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get (no one likes flicks) and the maximum possible number of flicks Sherlock can get from Moriarty. Note, that these two goals are different and the optimal result may be obtained by using different strategies.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of digits in the cards Sherlock and Moriarty are going to use.\n\nThe second line contains *n* digits\u00a0\u2014 Sherlock's credit card number.\n\nThe third line contains *n* digits\u00a0\u2014 Moriarty's credit card number.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFirst print the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get. Then print the maximum possible number of flicks that Sherlock can get from Moriarty.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n123\\n321\\n', '2\\n88\\n00\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0\\n2\\n', '2\\n0\\n']\n\nNote:\nFirst sample is elaborated in the problem statement.

        "prompt": "Title: Help Kingdom of Far Far Away 2\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nFor some time the program of rounding numbers that had been developed by the Codeforces participants during one of the previous rounds, helped the citizens of Far Far Away to convert numbers into a more easily readable format. However, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.\n\nThe King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows: \n -  A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point). -  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678 -  In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests). -  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets. -  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes ($), that's why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\". If the number should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be inside the brackets. \nFor example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored in the financial format as \"$2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be stored as \"($12,345,678.90)\".\n\nThe merchants of Far Far Away visited you again and expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert arbitrary numbers to the financial format. Can you help them?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input contains a number that needs to be converted into financial format. The number's notation length does not exceed 100 characters, including (possible) signs \"-\" (minus) and \".\" (decimal point). The number's notation is correct, that is: \n -  The number's notation only contains characters from the set {\"0\" \u2013 \"9\", \"-\", \".\"}. -  The decimal point (if it is present) is unique and is preceded and followed by a non-zero quantity on decimal digits -  A number cannot start with digit 0, except for a case when its whole integer part equals zero (in this case the integer parts is guaranteed to be a single zero: \"0\"). -  The minus sign (if it is present) is unique and stands in the very beginning of the number's notation -  If a number is identically equal to 0 (that is, if it is written as, for example, \"0\" or \"0.000\"), than it is not preceded by the minus sign. -  The input data contains no spaces. -  The number's notation contains at least one decimal digit.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the number given in the input in the financial format by the rules described in the problem statement.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2012\\n', '0.000\\n', '-0.00987654321\\n', '-12345678.9\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['$2,012.00', '$0.00', '($0.00)', '($12,345,678.90)']\n\nNote:\nPay attention to the second and third sample tests. They show that the sign of a number in the financial format (and consequently, the presence or absence of brackets) is determined solely by the sign of the initial number. It does not depend on the sign of the number you got after translating the number to the financial format.",

But even in the world of their dreams, while they are snoring peacefully, the sense of impending doom is still upon them.\n\nA poor student is dreaming that he is sitting the mathematical analysis exam. And he is examined by the most formidable professor of all times, a three times Soviet Union Hero, a Noble Prize laureate in student expulsion, venerable Petr Palych.\n\nThe poor student couldn't answer a single question. Thus, instead of a large spacious office he is going to apply for a job to thorium mines. But wait a minute! Petr Palych decided to give the student the last chance! Yes, that is possible only in dreams. \n\nSo the professor began: \"Once a Venusian girl and a Marsian boy met on the Earth and decided to take a walk holding hands. But the problem is the girl has *a**l* fingers on her left hand and *a**r* fingers on the right one. The boy correspondingly has *b**l* and *b**r* fingers. They can only feel comfortable when holding hands, when no pair of the girl's fingers will touch each other. That is, they are comfortable when between any two girl's fingers there is a boy's finger. And in addition, no three fingers of the boy should touch each other. Determine if they can hold hands so that the both were comfortable.\"\n\nThe boy any the girl don't care who goes to the left and who goes to the right. The difference is only that if the boy goes to the left of the girl, he will take her left hand with his right one, and if he goes to the right of the girl, then it is vice versa.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two positive integers not exceeding 100. They are the number of fingers on the Venusian girl's left and right hand correspondingly. The second line contains two integers not exceeding 100. They are the number of fingers on the Marsian boy's left and right hands correspondingly.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint YES or NO, that is, the answer to Petr Palych's question.\n\nDemo Input:\n['5 1\\n10 5\\n', '4 5\\n3 3\\n', '1 2\\n11 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nNote:\nThe boy and the girl don't really care who goes to the left.",

        "prompt": "Title: Ice Skating\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nBajtek is learning to skate on ice. He's a beginner, so his only mode of transportation is pushing off from a snow drift to the north, east, south or west and sliding until he lands in another snow drift. He has noticed that in this way it's impossible to get from some snow drifts to some other by any sequence of moves. He now wants to heap up some additional snow drifts, so that he can get from any snow drift to any other one.

        "prompt": "Title: Complete the Word\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nZS the Coder loves to read the dictionary. He thinks that a word is nice if there exists a substring (contiguous segment of letters) of it of length 26 where each letter of English alphabet appears exactly once. In particular, if the string has length strictly less than 26, no such substring exists and thus it is not nice.\n\nNow, ZS the Coder tells you a word, where some of its letters are missing as he forgot them. He wants to determine if it is possible to fill in the missing letters so that the resulting word is nice. If it is possible, he needs you to find an example of such a word as well. Can you help him?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first and only line of the input contains a single string *s* (1<=\u2264<=|*s*|<=\u2264<=50<=000), the word that ZS the Coder remembers. Each character of the string is the uppercase letter of English alphabet ('A'-'Z') or is a question mark ('?'), where the question marks denotes the letters that ZS the Coder can't remember.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there is no way to replace all the question marks with uppercase letters such that the resulting word is nice, then print <=-<=1 in the only line.\n\nOtherwise, print a string which denotes a possible nice word that ZS the Coder learned. This string should match the string from the input, except for the question marks replaced with uppercase English letters.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['ABC??FGHIJK???OPQR?TUVWXY?\\n', 'WELCOMETOCODEFORCESROUNDTHREEHUNDREDANDSEVENTYTWO\\n', '??????????????????????????\\n', 'AABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW??M\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRZTUVWXYS', '-1', 'MNBVCXZLKJHGFDSAQPWOEIRUYT', '-1']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample case, ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRZTUVWXYS is a valid answer beacuse it contains a substring of length 26 (the whole string in this case) which contains all the letters of the English alphabet exactly once. Note that there are many possible solutions, such as ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ or ABCEDFGHIJKLMNOPQRZTUVWXYS.\n\nIn the second sample case, there are no missing letters. In addition, the given string does not have a substring of length 26 that contains all the letters of the alphabet, so the answer is \u2009-\u20091.\n\nIn the third sample case, any string of length 26 that contains all letters of the English alphabet fits as an answer.",

        "prompt": "Title: Blinds\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe blinds are known to consist of opaque horizontal stripes that can be rotated thus regulating the amount of light flowing in the room. There are *n* blind stripes with the width of 1 in the factory warehouse for blind production. The problem is that all of them are spare details from different orders, that is, they may not have the same length (it is even possible for them to have different lengths)\n\nEvery stripe can be cut into two or more parts. The cuttings are made perpendicularly to the side along which the length is measured. Thus the cuttings do not change the width of a stripe but each of the resulting pieces has a lesser length (the sum of which is equal to the length of the initial stripe)\n\nAfter all the cuttings the blinds are constructed through consecutive joining of several parts, similar in length, along sides, along which length is measured. Also, apart from the resulting pieces an initial stripe can be used as a blind if it hasn't been cut. It is forbidden to construct blinds in any other way.\n\nThus, if the blinds consist of *k* pieces each *d* in length, then they are of form of a rectangle of *k*<=\u00d7<=*d* bourlemeters. \n\nYour task is to find for what window possessing the largest possible area the blinds can be made from the given stripes if on technical grounds it is forbidden to use pieces shorter than *l* bourlemeter. The window is of form of a rectangle with side lengths as positive integers.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first output line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *l* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*l*<=\u2264<=100). They are the number of stripes in the warehouse and the minimal acceptable length of a blind stripe in bourlemeters. The second line contains space-separated *n* integers *a**i*. They are the lengths of initial stripes in bourlemeters (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the single number \u2014 the maximal area of the window in square bourlemeters that can be completely covered. If no window with a positive area that can be covered completely without breaking any of the given rules exist, then print the single number 0.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 2\\n1 2 3 4\\n', '5 3\\n5 5 7 3 1\\n', '2 3\\n1 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['8\\n', '15\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample test the required window is 2\u2009\u00d7\u20094 in size and the blinds for it consist of 4 parts, each 2 bourlemeters long. One of the parts is the initial stripe with the length of 2, the other one is a part of a cut stripe with the length of 3 and the two remaining stripes are parts of a stripe with the length of 4 cut in halves.",

        "prompt": "Title: Towers\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAs you know, all the kids in Berland love playing with cubes. Little Petya has *n* towers consisting of cubes of the same size. Tower with number *i* consists of *a**i* cubes stacked one on top of the other. Petya defines the instability of a set of towers as a value equal to the difference between the heights of the highest and the lowest of the towers. For example, if Petya built five cube towers with heights (8, 3, 2, 6, 3), the instability of this set is equal to 6 (the highest tower has height 8, the lowest one has height 2). \n\nThe boy wants the instability of his set of towers to be as low as possible. All he can do is to perform the following operation several times: take the top cube from some tower and put it on top of some other tower of his set. Please note that Petya would never put the cube on the same tower from which it was removed because he thinks it's a waste of time. \n\nBefore going to school, the boy will have time to perform no more than *k* such operations. Petya does not want to be late for class, so you have to help him accomplish this task.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated positive integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100, 1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=1000) \u2014 the number of towers in the given set and the maximum number of operations Petya can perform. The second line contains *n* space-separated positive integers *a**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=104) \u2014 the towers' initial heights.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print two space-separated non-negative integers *s* and *m* (*m*<=\u2264<=*k*). The first number is the value of the minimum possible instability that can be obtained after performing at most *k* operations, the second number is the number of operations needed for that.\n\nIn the next *m* lines print the description of each operation as two positive integers *i* and *j*, each of them lies within limits from 1 to *n*. They represent that Petya took the top cube from the *i*-th tower and put in on the *j*-th one (*i*<=\u2260<=*j*). Note that in the process of performing operations the heights of some towers can become equal to zero.\n\nIf there are multiple correct sequences at which the minimum possible instability is achieved, you are allowed to print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\n5 8 5\\n', '3 4\\n2 2 4\\n', '5 3\\n8 3 2 6 3\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0 2\\n2 1\\n2 3\\n', '1 1\\n3 2\\n', '3 3\\n1 3\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample you need to move the cubes two times, from the second tower to the third one and from the second one to the first one. Then the heights of the towers are all the same and equal to 6.",

If you can solve this problem in large constraints, then you can just write a single solution to the both versions. If you find the problem too difficult in large constraints, you can write solution to the simplified version only.\n\nWaking up in the morning, Apollinaria decided to bake cookies. To bake one cookie, she needs *n* ingredients, and for each ingredient she knows the value *a**i*\u00a0\u2014 how many grams of this ingredient one needs to bake a cookie. To prepare one cookie Apollinaria needs to use all *n* ingredients.\n\nApollinaria has *b**i* gram of the *i*-th ingredient. Also she has *k* grams of a magic powder. Each gram of magic powder can be turned to exactly 1 gram of any of the *n* ingredients and can be used for baking cookies.\n\nYour task is to determine the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria is able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two positive integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of ingredients and the number of grams of the magic powder.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=1000), where the *i*-th number is equal to the number of grams of the *i*-th ingredient, needed to bake one cookie.\n\nThe third line contains the sequence *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=1000), where the *i*-th number is equal to the number of grams of the *i*-th ingredient, which Apollinaria has.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria will be able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 1\\n2 1 4\\n11 3 16\\n', '4 3\\n4 3 5 6\\n11 12 14 20\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['4\\n', '3\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample it is profitably for Apollinaria to make the existing 1 gram of her magic powder to ingredient with the index 2, then Apollinaria will be able to bake 4 cookies.\n\nIn the second sample Apollinaria should turn 1 gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index 1 and 1 gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index 3.

Drazil is sending a list of commands through Wi-Fi to Dreamoon's smartphone and Dreamoon follows them.\n\nEach command is one of the following two types: \n 1.  Go 1 unit towards the positive direction, denoted as '+' 1.  Go 1 unit towards the negative direction, denoted as '-' \nBut the Wi-Fi condition is so poor that Dreamoon's smartphone reports some of the commands can't be recognized and Dreamoon knows that some of them might even be wrong though successfully recognized. Dreamoon decides to follow every recognized command and toss a fair coin to decide those unrecognized ones (that means, he moves to the 1 unit to the negative or positive direction with the same probability 0.5). \n\nYou are given an original list of commands sent by Drazil and list received by Dreamoon. What is the probability that Dreamoon ends in the position originally supposed to be final by Drazil's commands?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a string *s*1 \u2014 the commands Drazil sends to Dreamoon, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-'}. \n\nThe second line contains a string *s*2 \u2014 the commands Dreamoon's smartphone recognizes, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-', '?'}. '?' denotes an unrecognized command.\n\nLengths of two strings are equal and do not exceed 10.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single real number corresponding to the probability.

So there are 2 correct cases out of 4, so the probability of finishing at the correct position is 0.5. \n\nFor the third sample, *s*<sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub> could only lead us to finish at positions {+1, -1, -3}, so the probability to finish at the correct position \u2009+\u20093 is 0.",

He learned that many programming languages generate such sequences in a similar way:  (for *i*<=\u2265<=1). Here *a*, *b*, *m* are constants, fixed for the given realization of the pseudorandom numbers generator, *r*0 is the so-called *randseed* (this value can be set from the program using functions like RandSeed(r) or srand(n)), and  denotes the operation of taking the remainder of division.\n\nFor example, if *a*<==<=2,<=*b*<==<=6,<=*m*<==<=12,<=*r*0<==<=11, the generated sequence will be: 4,<=2,<=10,<=2,<=10,<=2,<=10,<=2,<=10,<=2,<=10,<=....\n\nPolycarpus realized that any such sequence will sooner or later form a cycle, but the cycle may occur not in the beginning, so there exist a preperiod and a period. The example above shows a preperiod equal to 1 and a period equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to find the period of a sequence defined by the given values of *a*,<=*b*,<=*m* and *r*0.

Each line of the table contains one cell with a dwarf figurine, one cell with a candy, the other cells of the line are empty. The game lasts for several moves. During each move the player should choose all lines of the matrix where dwarf is not on the cell with candy and shout \"Let's go!\". After that, all the dwarves from the chosen lines start to simultaneously move to the right. During each second, each dwarf goes to the adjacent cell that is located to the right of its current cell.

        "prompt": "Title: Phone Numbers\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nWinters are just damn freezing cold in Nvodsk! That's why a group of *n* friends prefers to take a taxi, order a pizza and call girls. The phone numbers in the city consist of three pairs of digits (for example, 12-34-56). Each friend has a phonebook of size *s**i* (that's the number of phone numbers). We know that taxi numbers consist of six identical digits (for example, 22-22-22), the numbers of pizza deliveries should necessarily be decreasing sequences of six different digits (for example, 98-73-21), all other numbers are the girls' numbers.\n\nYou are given your friends' phone books. Calculate which friend is best to go to when you are interested in each of those things (who has maximal number of phone numbers of each type). \n\nIf the phone book of one person contains some number two times, you should count it twice. That is, each number should be taken into consideration the number of times it occurs in the phone book.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of friends. \n\nThen follow *n* data blocks that describe each friend's phone books. Each block is presented in the following form: first goes the line that contains integer *s**i* and string *name**i* (0<=\u2264<=*s**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of phone numbers in the phone book of the *i*-th friend and the name of the *i*-th friend. The name is a non-empty sequence of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, containing no more than 20 characters. Next *s**i* lines contain numbers as \"XX-XX-XX\", where X is arbitrary digits from 0 to 9.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print the phrase \"If you want to call a taxi, you should call: \". Then print names of all friends whose phone books contain maximal number of taxi phone numbers. \n\nIn the second line print the phrase \"If you want to order a pizza, you should call: \". Then print names of all friends who have maximal number of pizza phone numbers. \n\nIn the third line print the phrase \"If you want to go to a cafe with a wonderful girl, you should call: \". Then print names of all friends who have maximal number of girls' phone numbers. \n\nPrint the names in the order in which they are given in the input data. Separate two consecutive names with a comma and a space. Each line should end with exactly one point. For clarifications concerning the output form, see sample tests. It is necessary that you follow the output form strictly. Extra spaces are not allowed.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n2 Fedorov\\n22-22-22\\n98-76-54\\n3 Melnikov\\n75-19-09\\n23-45-67\\n99-99-98\\n7 Rogulenko\\n22-22-22\\n11-11-11\\n33-33-33\\n44-44-44\\n55-55-55\\n66-66-66\\n95-43-21\\n3 Kaluzhin\\n11-11-11\\n99-99-99\\n98-65-32\\n', '3\\n5 Gleb\\n66-66-66\\n55-55-55\\n01-01-01\\n65-43-21\\n12-34-56\\n3 Serega\\n55-55-55\\n87-65-43\\n65-55-21\\n5 Melnik\\n12-42-12\\n87-73-01\\n36-04-12\\n88-12-22\\n82-11-43\\n', '3\\n3 Kulczynski\\n22-22-22\\n65-43-21\\n98-12-00\\n4 Pachocki\\n11-11-11\\n11-11-11\\n11-11-11\\n98-76-54\\n0 Smietanka\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['If you want to call a taxi, you should call: Rogulenko.\\nIf you want to order a pizza, you should call: Fedorov, Rogulenko, Kaluzhin.\\nIf you want to go to a cafe with a wonderful girl, you should call: Melnikov.\\n', 'If you want to call a taxi, you should call: Gleb.\\nIf you want to order a pizza, you should call: Gleb, Serega.\\nIf you want to go to a cafe with a wonderful girl, you should call: Melnik.\\n', 'If you want to call a taxi, you should call: Pachocki.\\nIf you want to order a pizza, you should call: Kulczynski, Pachocki.\\nIf you want to go to a cafe with a wonderful girl, you should call: Kulczynski.\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample you are given four friends. Fedorov's phone book contains one taxi number and one pizza delivery number, Melnikov's phone book only has 3 numbers of girls, Rogulenko's one has 6 taxi numbers and one pizza delivery number, Kaluzhin's one contains 2 taxi numbers and one pizza delivery number.\n\nThus, if you need to order a taxi, you should obviously call Rogulenko, if you need to order a pizza you should call anybody of the following: Rogulenko, Fedorov, Kaluzhin (each of them has one number). Melnikov has maximal number of phone numbers of girls.",

        "prompt": "Title: Serial Time!\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe Cereal Guy's friend Serial Guy likes to watch soap operas. An episode is about to start, and he hasn't washed his plate yet. But he decided to at least put in under the tap to be filled with water. The plate can be represented by a parallelepiped *k*<=\u00d7<=*n*<=\u00d7<=*m*, that is, it has *k* layers (the first layer is the upper one), each of which is a rectangle *n*<=\u00d7<=*m* with empty squares ('.') and obstacles ('#'). The water can only be present in the empty squares. The tap is positioned above the square (*x*,<=*y*) of the first layer, it is guaranteed that this square is empty. Every minute a cubical unit of water falls into the plate. Find out in how many minutes the Serial Guy should unglue himself from the soap opera and turn the water off for it not to overfill the plate. That is, you should find the moment of time when the plate is absolutely full and is going to be overfilled in the next moment.\n\nNote: the water fills all the area within reach (see sample 4). Water flows in each of the 6 directions, through faces of 1<=\u00d7<=1<=\u00d7<=1 cubes.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three numbers *k*, *n*, *m* (1<=\u2264<=*k*,<=*n*,<=*m*<=\u2264<=10) which are the sizes of the plate. Then follow *k* rectangles consisting of *n* lines each containing *m* characters '.' or '#', which represents the \"layers\" of the plate in the order from the top to the bottom. The rectangles are separated by empty lines (see the samples).

Today he will attempt to join three atoms into one molecule.\n\nA molecule consists of atoms, with some pairs of atoms connected by atomic bonds. Each atom has a valence number \u2014 the number of bonds the atom must form with other atoms. An atom can form one or multiple bonds with any other atom, but it cannot form a bond with itself. The number of bonds of an atom in the molecule must be equal to its valence number.\n\nMike knows valence numbers of the three atoms. Find a molecule that can be built from these atoms according to the stated rules, or determine that it is impossible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line of the input contains three space-separated integers *a*, *b* and *c* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=106) \u2014 the valence numbers of the given atoms.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf such a molecule can be built, print three space-separated integers \u2014 the number of bonds between the 1-st and the 2-nd, the 2-nd and the 3-rd, the 3-rd and the 1-st atoms, correspondingly.

About each student you know the value *a**i* \u2014 the maximum number of messages which the *i*-th student is agree to send per day. The student can't send messages to himself. \n\nIn early morning Polycarp knew important news that the programming credit will be tomorrow. For this reason it is necessary to urgently inform all groupmates about this news using private messages. \n\nYour task is to make a plan of using private messages, so that:\n -  the student *i* sends no more than *a**i* messages (for all *i* from 1 to *n*); -  all students knew the news about the credit (initially only Polycarp knew it); -  the student can inform the other student only if he knows it himself. \nLet's consider that all students are numerated by distinct numbers from 1 to *n*, and Polycarp always has the number 1.\n\nIn that task you shouldn't minimize the number of messages, the moment of time, when all knew about credit or some other parameters.

In each of the next *k* lines print two distinct integers *f* and *t*, meaning that the student number *f* sent the message with news to the student number *t*. All messages should be printed in chronological order. It means that the student, who is sending the message, must already know this news. It is assumed that students can receive repeated messages with news of the credit. \n\nIf there are several answers, it is acceptable to print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n1 2 1 0\\n', '6\\n2 0 1 3 2 0\\n', '3\\n0 2 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n1 2\\n2 4\\n2 3\\n', '6\\n1 3\\n3 4\\n1 2\\n4 5\\n5 6\\n4 6\\n', '-1\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test Polycarp (the student number 1) can send the message to the student number 2, who after that can send the message to students number 3 and 4.

In this problem you are going to cut a sequence of integers.\n\nThere is a sequence of integers, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers. Given a limited budget, you need to make maximum possible number of cuts such that each resulting segment will have the same number of odd and even integers.\n\nCuts separate a sequence to continuous (contiguous) segments. You may think about each cut as a break between two adjacent elements in a sequence. So after cutting each element belongs to exactly one segment. Say, $[4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5]$ $\\to$ two cuts $\\to$ $[4, 1 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 4, 4, 5, 5]$. On each segment the number of even elements should be equal to the number of odd elements.\n\nThe cost of the cut between $x$ and $y$ numbers is $|x - y|$ bitcoins. Find the maximum possible number of cuts that can be made while spending no more than $B$ bitcoins.\n\nInput Specification:\nFirst line of the input contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100$) and an integer $B$ ($1 \\le B \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the sequence and the number of bitcoins you have.\n\nSecond line contains $n$ integers: $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 elements of the sequence, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the maximum possible number of cuts which can be made while spending no more than $B$ bitcoins.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6 4\\n1 2 5 10 15 20\\n', '4 10\\n1 3 2 4\\n', '6 100\\n1 2 3 4 5 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n', '0\\n', '2\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample the optimal answer is to split sequence between $2$ and $5$. Price of this cut is equal to $3$ bitcoins.\n\nIn the second sample it is not possible to make even one cut even with unlimited number of bitcoins.\n\nIn the third sample the sequence should be cut between $2$ and $3$, and between $4$ and $5$. The total price of the cuts is $1 + 1 = 2$ bitcoins.",

        "prompt": "Title: Help Chef Gerasim\n\nTime Limit: 0 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nIn a far away kingdom young pages help to set the table for the King. As they are terribly mischievous, one needs to keep an eye on the control whether they have set everything correctly. This time the royal chef Gerasim had the impression that the pages have played a prank again: they had poured the juice from one cup to another. Now Gerasim wants to check his hypothesis. The good thing is that chef Gerasim always pour the same number of milliliters of juice to all cups in the royal kitchen. Having thoroughly measured the juice in each cup, Gerasim asked you to write a program that will determine from which cup juice was poured to which one; otherwise, the program should determine that this time the pages set the table diligently.\n\nTo simplify your task we shall consider the cups to be bottomless so that the juice never overfills a cup and pours out, however much it can be. Besides, by some strange reason in a far away kingdom one can only pour to a cup or from one cup to another an integer number of milliliters of juice.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* \u2014 the number of cups on the royal table (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000). Next *n* lines contain volumes of juice in each cup \u2014 non-negative integers, not exceeding 104.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the pages didn't pour the juice, print \"Exemplary pages.\" (without the quotes). If you can determine the volume of juice poured during exactly one juice pouring, print \"*v* ml. from cup #*a* to cup #*b*.\" (without the quotes), where *v* represents the volume of poured juice, *a* represents the number of the cup from which the juice was poured (the cups are numbered with consecutive positive integers starting from one in the order in which the cups are described in the input data), *b* represents the number of the cup into which the juice was poured. Finally, if the given juice's volumes cannot be obtained using no more than one pouring (for example, the pages poured the juice from one cup to another more than once or the royal kitchen maids poured the juice into the cups incorrectly), print \"Unrecoverable configuration.\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['5\\n270\\n250\\n250\\n230\\n250\\n', '5\\n250\\n250\\n250\\n250\\n250\\n', '5\\n270\\n250\\n249\\n230\\n250\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['20 ml. from cup #4 to cup #1.\\n', 'Exemplary pages.\\n', 'Unrecoverable configuration.\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The keyboard has only ten digital equal-sized keys, located in the following way:\n\nTogether with his old phone, he lost all his contacts and now he can only remember the way his fingers moved when he put some number in.

For example, the finger movements for number \"586\" are the same as finger movements for number \"253\":\n\nMike has already put in a number by his \"finger memory\" and started calling it, so he is now worrying, can he be sure that he is calling the correct number?

Naturally, Vasya keeps all the coins in his collection in the order in which they were released. Once Vasya's younger brother made a change \u2014 he took all the coins whose release year dated from *l* to *r* inclusively and put them in the reverse order. That is, he took a certain segment [*l*,<=*r*] and reversed it. At that the segment's endpoints did not coincide. For example, if *n*<==<=8, then initially Vasya's coins were kept in the order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. If Vasya's younger brother chose the segment [2,<=6], then after the reversal the coin order will change to 1 6 5 4 3 2 7 8. Vasya suspects that someone else could have spoilt the permutation after his brother. Help him to find that out. Check if the given permutation can be obtained from the permutation 1 2 ... *n* using exactly one segment reversal. If it is possible, find the segment itself.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000) which is the number of coins in Vasya's collection. The second line contains space-separated *n* integers which are the spoilt sequence of coins. It is guaranteed that the given sequence is a permutation, i.e. it contains only integers from 1 to *n*, and every number is used exactly 1 time.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf it is impossible to obtain the given permutation from the original one in exactly one action, print 0 0. Otherwise, print two numbers *l* *r* (1<=\u2264<=*l*<=&lt;<=*r*<=\u2264<=*n*) which are the endpoints of the segment that needs to be reversed to obtain from permutation 1 2 ... *n* the given one.\n\nDemo Input:\n['8\\n1 6 5 4 3 2 7 8\\n', '4\\n2 3 4 1\\n', '4\\n1 2 3 4\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2 6\\n', '0 0\\n', '0 0\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Intense Heat\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.\n\nMathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:\n\nSuppose we want to analyze the segment of $n$ consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these $n$ days; the temperature during $i$-th day equals $a_i$.\n\nWe denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day $x$ to day $y$, we calculate it as $\\frac{\\sum \\limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1}$ (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ and $k = 3$, we are interested in segments $[3, 4, 1]$, $[4, 1, 2]$ and $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).\n\nYou have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task?\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 5000$) \u2014 the number of days in the given period, and the minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat intensity value, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 5000$) \u2014 the temperature measures during given $n$ days.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint one real number \u2014 the heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than $k$ consecutive days.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if the following condition holds: $|res - res_0| &lt; 10^{-6}$, where $res$ is your answer, and $res_0$ is the answer given by the jury's solution.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 3\\n3 4 1 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2.666666666666667\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

But each knight has some power and a knight can kill another knight if and only if his power is greater than the power of victim. However, even such a knight will torment his conscience, so he can kill no more than $k$ other knights. Also, each knight has some number of coins. After a kill, a knight can pick up all victim's coins.\n\nNow each knight ponders: how many coins he can have if only he kills other knights?\n\nYou should answer this question for each knight.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ $(1 \\le n \\le 10^5, 0 \\le k \\le \\min(n-1,10))$ \u2014 the number of knights and the number $k$ from the statement.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2 ,\\ldots,p_n$ $(1 \\le p_i \\le 10^9)$ \u2014 powers of the knights.

That leaves him with the only coin he initially has. -  The second knight can kill the first knight and add his coin to his own two. -  The third knight is the strongest, but he can't kill more than $k = 2$ other knights. It is optimal to kill the second and the fourth knights: $2+11+33 = 46$. -  The fourth knight should kill the first and the second knights: $33+1+2 = 36$. \nIn the second example the first knight can't kill anyone, while all the others should kill the one with the index less by one than their own.\n\nIn the third example there is only one knight, so he can't kill anyone.",

He does not like this subject much, but *d* days ago he learnt that he would have to take this exam. Peter's strict parents made him prepare for the exam immediately, for this purpose he has to study not less than *minTime**i* and not more than *maxTime**i* hours per each *i*-th day. Moreover, they warned Peter that a day before the exam they would check how he has followed their instructions.\n\nSo, today is the day when Peter's parents ask him to show the timetable of his preparatory studies. But the boy has counted only the sum of hours *sumTime* spent him on preparation, and now he wants to know if he can show his parents a timetable *s\u0441hedule* with *d* numbers, where each number *s\u0441hedule**i* stands for the time in hours spent by Peter each *i*-th day on biology studies, and satisfying the limitations imposed by his parents, and at the same time the sum total of all *schedule**i* should equal to *sumTime*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains two integer numbers *d*,<=*sumTime* (1<=\u2264<=*d*<=\u2264<=30,<=0<=\u2264<=*sumTime*<=\u2264<=240) \u2014 the amount of days, during which Peter studied, and the total amount of hours, spent on preparation.

Luckily there are social networks\u00a0\u2014 they store all your message history making it easy to know what you argued over 10 years ago.\n\nMore formal, your message history is a sequence of messages ordered by time sent numbered from 1 to *n* where *n* is the total number of messages in the chat.\n\nEach message might contain a link to an earlier message which it is a reply to. When opening a message *x* or getting a link to it, the dialogue is shown in such a way that *k* previous messages, message *x* and *k* next messages are visible (with respect to message *x*). In case there are less than *k* messages somewhere, they are yet all shown.\n\nDigging deep into your message history, you always read all visible messages and then go by the link in the current message *x* (if there is one) and continue reading in the same manner.\n\nDetermine the number of messages you'll read if your start from message number *t* for all *t* from 1 to *n*. Calculate these numbers independently. If you start with message *x*, the initial configuration is *x* itself, *k* previous and *k* next messages. Messages read multiple times are considered as one.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the total amount of messages and the number of previous and next messages visible.\n\nThe second line features a sequence of integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=&lt;<=*i*), where *a**i* denotes the *i*-th message link destination or zero, if there's no link from *i*. All messages are listed in chronological order. It's guaranteed that the link from message *x* goes to message with number strictly less than *x*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* integers with *i*-th denoting the number of distinct messages you can read starting from message *i* and traversing the links while possible.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6 0\\n0 1 1 2 3 2\\n', '10 1\\n0 1 0 3 4 5 2 3 7 0\\n', '2 2\\n0 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 2 2 3 3 3 \\n', '2 3 3 4 5 6 6 6 8 2 \\n', '2 2 \\n']\n\nNote:\nConsider *i*\u2009=\u20096 in sample case one. You will read message 6, then 2, then 1 and then there will be no link to go.\n\nIn the second sample case *i*\u2009=\u20096 gives you messages 5,\u20096,\u20097 since *k*\u2009=\u20091, then 4,\u20095,\u20096, then 2,\u20093,\u20094 and then the link sequence breaks.

That's why many people today are busy preparing New Year presents. Vasily the Programmer is no exception.\n\nVasily knows that the best present is (no, it's not a contest) money. He's put *n* empty wallets from left to right in a row and decided how much money to put in what wallet. Vasily decided to put *a**i* coins to the *i*-th wallet from the left.\n\nVasily is a very busy man, so the money are sorted into the bags by his robot. Initially, the robot stands by the leftmost wallet in the row. The robot can follow instructions of three types: go to the wallet that is to the left of the current one (if such wallet exists), go to the wallet that is to the right of the current one (if such wallet exists), put a coin to the current wallet. Due to some technical malfunctions the robot cannot follow two \"put a coin\" instructions in a row.\n\nVasily doesn't want to wait for long, so he wants to write a program for the robot that contains at most 106 operations (not necessarily minimum in length) the robot can use to put coins into the wallets. Help him.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=300) \u2014 the number of wallets. The next line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=300).\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one *a**i* is positive.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the sequence that consists of *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=106) characters, each of them equals: \"L\", \"R\" or \"P\". Each character of the sequence is an instruction to the robot. Character \"L\" orders to move to the left, character \"R\" orders to move to the right, character \"P\" orders the robot to put a coin in the wallet. The robot is not allowed to go beyond the wallet line. In other words, you cannot give instructions \"L\" if the robot is at wallet 1, or \"R\" at wallet *n*.\n\nAs a result of the performed operations, the *i*-th wallet from the left must contain exactly *a**i* coins.

All *n* participants who have made it to the finals found themselves in a huge *m*-floored 108-star hotel. Of course the first thought to come in a place like this is \"How about checking out the elevator?\".\n\nThe hotel's elevator moves between floors according to one never changing scheme. Initially (at the moment of time 0) the elevator is located on the 1-st floor, then it moves to the 2-nd floor, then \u2014 to the 3-rd floor and so on until it reaches the *m*-th floor. After that the elevator moves to floor *m*<=-<=1, then to floor *m*<=-<=2, and so on until it reaches the first floor. This process is repeated infinitely. We know that the elevator has infinite capacity; we also know that on every floor people get on the elevator immediately. Moving between the floors takes a unit of time.\n\nFor each of the *n* participant you are given *s**i*, which represents the floor where the *i*-th participant starts, *f**i*, which represents the floor the *i*-th participant wants to reach, and *t**i*, which represents the time when the *i*-th participant starts on the floor *s**i*.\n\nFor each participant print the minimum time of his/her arrival to the floor *f**i*. \n\nIf the elevator stops on the floor *s**i* at the time *t**i*, then the *i*-th participant can enter the elevator immediately. If the participant starts on the floor *s**i* and that's the floor he wanted to reach initially (*s**i*<==<=*f**i*), then the time of arrival to the floor *f**i* for this participant is considered equal to *t**i*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=2<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=108). \n\nNext *n* lines contain information about the participants in the form of three space-separated integers *s**i* *f**i* *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*s**i*,<=*f**i*<=\u2264<=*m*,<=0<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=108), described in the problem statement.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint *n* lines each containing one integer \u2014 the time of the arrival for each participant to the required floor.\n\nDemo Input:\n['7 4\\n2 4 3\\n1 2 0\\n2 2 0\\n1 2 1\\n4 3 5\\n1 2 2\\n4 2 0\\n', '5 5\\n1 5 4\\n1 3 1\\n1 3 4\\n3 1 5\\n4 2 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['9\\n1\\n0\\n7\\n10\\n7\\n5\\n', '12\\n10\\n10\\n8\\n7\\n']\n\nNote:\nLet's consider the first sample.

To get to the floor *f*\u2009=\u20094, he has to wait until the time equals 7, that's the time when the elevator will go upwards for the second time. Then the first participant should get on the elevator and go two floors up. In this case the first participant gets to the floor *f* at time equal to 9. The second participant starts at the time *t*\u2009=\u20090 on the floor *s*\u2009=\u20091, enters the elevator immediately, and arrives to the floor *f*\u2009=\u20092. The third participant doesn't wait for the elevator, because he needs to arrive to the same floor where he starts.",

The string consists of *n* lowercase English letters (that is, the string's length equals *n*), exactly *k* of these letters are distinct. 1.  No two neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent a string as *s*<==<=*s*1*s*2... *s**n*, then the following inequality holds, *s**i*<=\u2260<=*s**i*<=+<=1(1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n*). 1.  Among all strings that meet points 1 and 2, the required string is lexicographically smallest. \nHelp him find such string or state that such string doesn't exist.\n\nString *x*<==<=*x*1*x*2... *x**p* is lexicographically less than string *y*<==<=*y*1*y*2... *y**q*, if either *p*<=&lt;<=*q* and *x*1<==<=*y*1,<=*x*2<==<=*y*2,<=... ,<=*x**p*<==<=*y**p*, or there is such number *r* (*r*<=&lt;<=*p*,<=*r*<=&lt;<=*q*), that *x*1<==<=*y*1,<=*x*2<==<=*y*2,<=... ,<=*x**r*<==<=*y**r* and *x**r*<=+<=1<=&lt;<=*y**r*<=+<=1.

He found a note instead of them. It turned out that his smart roommate hid the flakes in one of *n* boxes. The boxes stand in one row, they are numbered from 1 to *n* from the left to the right. The roommate left hints like \"Hidden to the left of the *i*-th box\" (\"To the left of *i*\"), \"Hidden to the right of the *i*-th box\" (\"To the right of *i*\"). Such hints mean that there are no flakes in the *i*-th box as well. The Cereal Guy wants to know the minimal number of boxes he necessarily needs to check to find the flakes considering all the hints. Or he wants to find out that the hints are contradictory and the roommate lied to him, that is, no box has the flakes.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=1000) which represent the number of boxes and the number of hints correspondingly. Next *m* lines contain hints like \"To the left of *i*\" and \"To the right of *i*\", where *i* is integer (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*).

The whole Berland, the old and the young, are watching the show.\n\nThe rules are simple. The host thinks of an integer *y* and the participants guess it by asking questions to the host. There are four types of acceptable questions:\n -  Is it true that *y* is strictly larger than number *x*? -  Is it true that *y* is strictly smaller than number *x*? -  Is it true that *y* is larger than or equal to number *x*? -  Is it true that *y* is smaller than or equal to number *x*? \nOn each question the host answers truthfully, \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nGiven the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of *y* that meets the criteria of all answers.

        "prompt": "Title: Heroes\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe year of 2012 is coming...\n\nAccording to an ancient choradrican legend in this very year, in 2012, Diablo and his brothers Mephisto and Baal will escape from hell, and innumerable hordes of demons will enslave the human world. But seven brave heroes have already gathered on the top of a mountain Arreat to protect us mere mortals from the effect of this terrible evil.\n\nThe seven great heroes are: amazon Anka, barbarian Chapay, sorceress Cleo, druid Troll, necromancer Dracul, paladin Snowy and a professional hit girl Hexadecimal. Heroes already know how much experience will be given for each of the three megabosses: *a* for Mephisto, *b* for Diablo and *c* for Baal.\n\nHere's the problem: heroes are as much as seven and megabosses are only three! Then our heroes decided to split into three teams, where each team will go to destroy their own megaboss. Each team member will receive a  of experience, rounded down, where *x* will be the amount of experience for the killed megaboss and *y* \u2014 the number of people in the team.\n\nHeroes do not want to hurt each other's feelings, so they want to split into teams so that the difference between the hero who received the maximum number of experience and the hero who received the minimum number of experience were minimal. Since there can be several divisions into teams, then you need to find the one in which the total amount of liking in teams were maximum.\n\nIt is known that some heroes like others. But if hero *p* likes hero *q*, this does not mean that the hero *q* likes hero *p*. No hero likes himself.\n\nThe total amount of liking in teams is the amount of ordered pairs (*p*,<=*q*), such that heroes *p* and *q* are in the same group, and hero *p* likes hero *q* (but it is not important if hero *q* likes hero *p*). In case of heroes *p* and *q* likes each other and they are in the same group, this pair should be counted twice, as (*p*,<=*q*) and (*q*,<=*p*).\n\nA team can consist even of a single hero, but it is important that every megaboss was destroyed. All heroes must be involved in the campaign against evil. None of the heroes can be in more than one team.\n\nIt is guaranteed that every hero is able to destroy any megaboss alone.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single non-negative integer *n* (0<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=42) \u2014 amount of liking between the heroes. Next *n* lines describe liking in the form \"p likes q\", meaning that the hero p likes the hero q (p <=\u2260<= q). Every liking is described in the input exactly once, no hero likes himself.\n\nIn the last line are given three integers *a*, *b* and *c* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*c*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7109), separated by spaces: the experience for Mephisto, the experience for Diablo and experience for Baal.\n\nIn all the pretests, except for examples from the statement, the following condition is satisfied: *a*<==<=*b*<==<=*c*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint two integers \u2014 the minimal difference in the experience between two heroes who will receive the maximum and minimum number of experience points, and the maximal total amount of liking in teams (the number of friendships between heroes that end up in one team).\n\nWhen calculating the second answer, the team division should satisfy the difference-minimizing contraint. I.e. primary you should minimize the difference in the experience and secondary you should maximize the total amount of liking.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\nTroll likes Dracul\\nDracul likes Anka\\nSnowy likes Hexadecimal\\n210 200 180\\n', '2\\nAnka likes Chapay\\nChapay likes Anka\\n10000 50 50\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['30 3\\n', '1950 2\\n']\n\nNote:\nA note to first example: it the first team should be Dracul, Troll and Anka, in the second one Hexadecimal and Snowy, and in the third Cleo \u0438 Chapay.",

Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (*l* \u2014 left, *s* \u2014 straight, *r* \u2014 right) and a light *p* for a pedestrian crossing. \n\nAn accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.\n\nNow, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.\n\nEach line contains four integers *l*, *s*, *r*, *p* \u2014 for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively.

From each of the *m* Berland regions a team of two people is invited to participate in the olympiad. The qualifying contest to form teams was held and it was attended by *n* Berland students. There were at least two schoolboys participating from each of the *m* regions of Berland. The result of each of the participants of the qualifying competition is an integer score from 0 to 800 inclusive.\n\nThe team of each region is formed from two such members of the qualifying competition of the region, that none of them can be replaced by a schoolboy of the same region, not included in the team and who received a greater number of points. There may be a situation where a team of some region can not be formed uniquely, that is, there is more than one school team that meets the properties described above. In this case, the region needs to undertake an additional contest. The two teams in the region are considered to be different if there is at least one schoolboy who is included in one team and is not included in the other team.

In the pattern, 0 stands for the even digits, while 1 stands for the odd. Integer *x* matches the pattern *s*, if the parity of the *i*-th from the right digit in decimal notation matches the *i*-th from the right digit of the pattern. If the pattern is shorter than this integer, it's supplemented with 0-s from the left. Similarly, if the integer is shorter than the pattern its decimal notation is supplemented with the 0-s from the left. \nFor example, if the pattern is *s*<==<=010, than integers 92, 2212, 50 and 414 match the pattern, while integers 3, 110, 25 and 1030 do not.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains an integer *t* (1<=\u2264<=*t*<=\u2264<=100<=000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of operation Sonya has to perform.\n\nNext *t* lines provide the descriptions of the queries in order they appear in the input file. The *i*-th row starts with a character *c**i*\u00a0\u2014 the type of the corresponding operation. If *c**i* is equal to '+' or '-' then it's followed by a space and an integer *a**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=&lt;<=1018) given without leading zeroes (unless it's 0). If *c**i* equals '?' then it's followed by a space and a sequence of zeroes and onse, giving the pattern of length no more than 18.\n\nIt's guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type '?'.\n\nIt's guaranteed that any time some integer is removed from the multiset, there will be at least one occurrence of this integer in it.\n\nOutput Specification:\nFor each query of the third type print the number of integers matching the given pattern.

For your birthday, your friends have given you an array *a* consisting of *n* distinct integers.\n\nUnfortunately, the size of *a* is too small. You want a bigger array! Your friends agree to give you a bigger array, but only if you are able to answer the following question correctly: is it possible to sort the array *a* (in increasing order) by reversing exactly one segment of *a*?

Alice will get all the pieces marked *A* and Bob will get all the pieces marked *B*. \nThe strength of a player is then the sum of strengths of the pieces in the group.\n\nGiven Alice's initial split into two teams, help Bob determine an optimal strategy.

At the time, they are very happy to have seen each other after a long time. The sun is shining, birds are singing, flowers are blooming, and their Potions class teacher, professor Snipe is sulky as usual. Due to his angst fueled by disappointment in his own life, he has given them a lot of homework in Potions class. \n\nEach of the *n* students has been assigned a single task. Some students do certain tasks faster than others. Thus, they want to redistribute the tasks so that each student still does exactly one task, and that all tasks are finished. Each student has their own laziness level, and each task has its own difficulty level. Professor Snipe is trying hard to improve their work ethics, so each student\u2019s laziness level is equal to their task\u2019s difficulty level. Both sets of values are given by the sequence *a*, where *a**i* represents both the laziness level of the *i*-th student and the difficulty of his task. \n\nThe time a student needs to finish a task is equal to the product of their laziness level and the task\u2019s difficulty. They are wondering, what is the minimum possible total time they must spend to finish all tasks if they distribute them in the optimal way. Each person should receive one task and each task should be given to one person.

No, no, there was no firing from machine guns or radiation mutants time-travels!\n\nThere was a beauty named Belle. Once she had violated the Beast's order and visited the West Wing. After that she was banished from the castle... \n\nEverybody was upset. The beautiful Belle was upset, so was the Beast, so was Lumiere the candlestick. But the worst thing was that Cogsworth was upset. Cogsworth is not a human, but is the mantel clock, which was often used as an alarm clock.\n\nDue to Cogsworth's frustration all the inhabitants of the castle were in trouble: now they could not determine when it was time to drink morning tea, and when it was time for an evening stroll. \n\nFortunately, deep in the basement are lying digital clock showing the time in the format HH:MM. Now the residents of the castle face a difficult task. They should turn Cogsworth's hour and minute mustache hands in such a way, that Cogsworth began to show the correct time. Moreover they need to find turn angles in degrees for each mustache hands. The initial time showed by Cogsworth is 12:00.\n\nYou can only rotate the hands forward, that is, as is shown in the picture: \n\nAs since there are many ways too select such angles because of full rotations, choose the smallest angles in the right (non-negative) direction.\n\nNote that Cogsworth's hour and minute mustache hands move evenly and continuously. Hands are moving independently, so when turning one hand the other hand remains standing still.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line of input contains current time according to the digital clock, formatted as HH:MM (00<=\u2264<=HH<=\u2264<=23, 00<=\u2264<=MM<=\u2264<=59). The mantel clock initially shows 12:00.\n\nPretests contain times of the beginning of some morning TV programs of the Channel One Russia.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint two numbers *x* and *y* \u2014 the angles of turning the hour and minute hands, respectively (0<=\u2264<=*x*,<=*y*<=&lt;<=360). The absolute or relative error in the answer should not exceed 10<=-<=9.\n\nDemo Input:\n['12:00\\n', '04:30\\n', '08:17\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0 0', '135 180', '248.5 102']\n\nNote:\nA note to the second example: the hour hand will be positioned exactly in the middle, between 4 and 5.",

Indeed, such natural phenomena strongly influence all life on our planet.\n\nOur hero Vasya is quite concerned about the problems. He decided to try a little experiment and observe how outside daily temperature changes. He hung out a thermometer on the balcony every morning and recorded the temperature. He had been measuring the temperature for the last *n* days. Thus, he got a sequence of numbers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n*, where the *i*-th number is the temperature on the *i*-th day.\n\nVasya analyzed the temperature statistics in other cities, and came to the conclusion that the city has no environmental problems, if first the temperature outside is negative for some non-zero number of days, and then the temperature is positive for some non-zero number of days. More formally, there must be a positive integer *k* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1) such that *t*1<=&lt;<=0,<=*t*2<=&lt;<=0,<=...,<=*t**k*<=&lt;<=0 and *t**k*<=+<=1<=&gt;<=0,<=*t**k*<=+<=2<=&gt;<=0,<=...,<=*t**n*<=&gt;<=0. In particular, the temperature should never be zero. If this condition is not met, Vasya decides that his city has environmental problems, and gets upset.\n\nYou do not want to upset Vasya. Therefore, you want to select multiple values of temperature and modify them to satisfy Vasya's condition. You need to know what the least number of temperature values needs to be changed for that.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a single integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105) \u2014 the number of days for which Vasya has been measuring the temperature. \n\nThe second line contains a sequence of *n* integers *t*1,<=*t*2,<=...,<=*t**n* (|*t**i*|<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 the sequence of temperature values.

        "prompt": "Title: Dorm Water Supply\n\nTime Limit: 1 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nThe German University in Cairo (GUC) dorm houses are numbered from 1 to *n*. Underground water pipes connect these houses together. Each pipe has certain direction (water can flow only in this direction and not vice versa), and diameter (which characterizes the maximal amount of water it can handle).\n\nFor each house, there is at most one pipe going into it and at most one pipe going out of it. With the new semester starting, GUC student and dorm resident, Lulu, wants to install tanks and taps at the dorms. For every house with an outgoing water pipe and without an incoming water pipe, Lulu should install a water tank at that house. For every house with an incoming water pipe and without an outgoing water pipe, Lulu should install a water tap at that house. Each tank house will convey water to all houses that have a sequence of pipes from the tank to it. Accordingly, each tap house will receive water originating from some tank house.\n\nIn order to avoid pipes from bursting one week later (like what happened last semester), Lulu also has to consider the diameter of the pipes. The amount of water each tank conveys should not exceed the diameter of the pipes connecting a tank to its corresponding tap. Lulu wants to find the maximal amount of water that can be safely conveyed from each tank to its corresponding tap.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *n* and *p* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*p*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of houses and the number of pipes correspondingly. \n\nThen *p* lines follow \u2014 the description of *p* pipes. The *i*-th line contains three integers *a**i* *b**i* *d**i*, indicating a pipe of diameter *d**i* going from house *a**i* to house *b**i* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*,<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i*,<=1<=\u2264<=*d**i*<=\u2264<=106).\n\nIt is guaranteed that for each house there is at most one pipe going into it and at most one pipe going out of it.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint integer *t* in the first line \u2014 the number of tank-tap pairs of houses.\n\nFor the next *t* lines, print 3 integers per line, separated by spaces: *tank**i*, *tap**i*, and *diameter**i*, where *tank**i*<=\u2260<=*tap**i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*t*). Here *tank**i* and *tap**i* are indexes of tank and tap houses respectively, and *diameter**i* is the maximum amount of water that can be conveyed. All the *t* lines should be ordered (increasingly) by *tank**i*.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\n1 2 10\\n2 3 20\\n', '3 3\\n1 2 20\\n2 3 10\\n3 1 5\\n', '4 2\\n1 2 60\\n3 4 50\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\n1 3 10\\n', '0\\n', '2\\n1 2 60\\n3 4 50\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Chord\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nVasya studies music. \n\nHe has learned lots of interesting stuff. For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.\n\nLet's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes *X*, *Y* and *Z*. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between *X* and *Y* equals 4 semitones and the distance between *Y* and *Z* is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between *X* and *Z*, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad is different in that the distance between *X* and *Y* should be 3 semitones and between *Y* and *Z* \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nFor example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.\n\nHelp Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\nDemo Input:\n['C E G\\n', 'C# B F\\n', 'A B H\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['major\\n', 'minor\\n', 'strange\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The bears are so greedy that they are ready to fight for the larger piece. That's where the fox comes in and starts the dialog: \"Little bears, wait a little, I want to make your pieces equal\" \"Come off it fox, how are you going to do that?\", the curious bears asked. \"It's easy\", said the fox. \"If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by two, then I can eat exactly a half of the piece. If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by three, then I can eat exactly two-thirds, and if the mass is divisible by five, then I can eat four-fifths. I'll eat a little here and there and make the pieces equal\". \n\nThe little bears realize that the fox's proposal contains a catch. But at the same time they realize that they can not make the two pieces equal themselves. So they agreed to her proposal, but on one condition: the fox should make the pieces equal as quickly as possible. Find the minimum number of operations the fox needs to make pieces equal.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *a* and *b* (1<=\u2264<=*a*,<=*b*<=\u2264<=109).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the fox is lying to the little bears and it is impossible to make the pieces equal, print -1. Otherwise, print the required minimum number of operations. If the pieces of the cheese are initially equal, the required number is 0.\n\nDemo Input:\n['15 20\\n', '14 8\\n', '6 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '-1\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

        "prompt": "Title: Friends or Not\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPolycarpus has a hobby \u2014 he develops an unusual social network. His work is almost completed, and there is only one more module to implement \u2014 the module which determines friends. Oh yes, in this social network one won't have to add friends manually! Pairs of friends are deduced in the following way. Let's assume that user *A* sent user *B* a message at time *t*1, and user *B* sent user *A* a message at time *t*2. If 0<=&lt;<=*t*2<=-<=*t*1<=\u2264<=*d*, then user *B*'s message was an answer to user *A*'s one. Users *A* and *B* are considered to be friends if *A* answered at least one *B*'s message or *B* answered at least one *A*'s message.\n\nYou are given the log of messages in chronological order and a number *d*. Find all pairs of users who will be considered to be friends.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *d* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*d*<=\u2264<=1000). The next *n* lines contain the messages log. The *i*-th line contains one line of the log formatted as \"*A**i* *B**i* *t**i*\" (without the quotes), which means that user *A**i* sent a message to user *B**i* at time *t**i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*). *A**i* and *B**i* are non-empty strings at most 20 characters long, consisting of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z'), and *t**i* is an integer (0<=\u2264<=*t**i*<=\u2264<=10000). It is guaranteed that the lines are given in non-decreasing order of *t**i*'s and that no user sent a message to himself. The elements in the lines are separated by single spaces.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line print integer *k* \u2014 the number of pairs of friends. In the next *k* lines print pairs of friends as \"*A**i* *B**i*\" (without the quotes). You can print users in pairs and the pairs themselves in any order. Each pair must be printed exactly once.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 1\\nvasya petya 1\\npetya vasya 2\\nanya ivan 2\\nivan anya 4\\n', '1 1000\\na b 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1\\npetya vasya\\n', '0\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample test case Vasya and Petya are friends because their messages' sending times are one second apart. Anya and Ivan are not, because their messages' sending times differ by more than one second.",

Different traffic lights can have different waiting time.\n\nThe traffic light on the crosswalk from the *j*-th house of the *i*-th row to the (*j*<=+<=1)-th house of the same row has waiting time equal to *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=2,<=1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*<=-<=1). For the traffic light on the crossing from the *j*-th house of one row to the *j*-th house of another row the waiting time equals *b**j* (1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*). The city doesn't have any other crossings.\n\nThe boy wants to get to the store, buy the products and go back. The main avenue of the city is wide enough, so the boy wants to cross it exactly once on the way to the store and exactly once on the way back home. The boy would get bored if he had to walk the same way again, so he wants the way home to be different from the way to the store in at least one crossing.\n\nHelp Laurenty determine the minimum total time he needs to wait at the crossroads.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=50) \u2014 the number of houses in each row. \n\nEach of the next two lines contains *n*<=-<=1 space-separated integer \u2014 values *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=100). \n\nThe last line contains *n* space-separated integers *b**j* (1<=\u2264<=*b**j*<=\u2264<=100).\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the least total time Laurenty needs to wait at the crossroads, given that he crosses the avenue only once both on his way to the store and on his way back home.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4\\n1 2 3\\n3 2 1\\n3 2 2 3\\n', '3\\n1 2\\n3 3\\n2 1 3\\n', '2\\n1\\n1\\n1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['12\\n', '11\\n', '4\\n']\n\nNote:\nThe first sample is shown on the figure above. \n\nIn the second sample, Laurenty's path can look as follows: \n -  Laurenty crosses the avenue, the waiting time is 3; -  Laurenty uses the second crossing in the first row, the waiting time is 2; -  Laurenty uses the first crossing in the first row, the waiting time is 1; -  Laurenty uses the first crossing in the first row, the waiting time is 1; -  Laurenty crosses the avenue, the waiting time is 1; -  Laurenty uses the second crossing in the second row, the waiting time is 3. \nIn the last sample Laurenty visits all the crossings, so the answer is 4.",

        "prompt": "Title: Spiders\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne day mum asked Petya to sort his toys and get rid of some of them. Petya found a whole box of toy spiders. They were quite dear to him and the boy didn't want to throw them away. Petya conjured a cunning plan: he will glue all the spiders together and attach them to the ceiling. Besides, Petya knows that the lower the spiders will hang, the more mum is going to like it and then she won't throw his favourite toys away. Help Petya carry out the plan.\n\nA spider consists of *k* beads tied together by *k*<=-<=1 threads. Each thread connects two different beads, at that any pair of beads that make up a spider is either directly connected by a thread, or is connected via some chain of threads and beads.\n\nPetya may glue spiders together directly gluing their beads. The length of each thread equals 1. The sizes of the beads can be neglected. That's why we can consider that gluing spiders happens by identifying some of the beads (see the picture). Besides, the construction resulting from the gluing process should also represent a spider, that is, it should have the given features. \n\nAfter Petya glues all spiders together, he measures the length of the resulting toy. The distance between a pair of beads is identified as the total length of the threads that connect these two beads. The length of the resulting construction is the largest distance between all pairs of beads. Petya wants to make the spider whose length is as much as possible.\n\nThe picture two shows two spiders from the second sample. We can glue to the bead number 2 of the first spider the bead number 1 of the second spider. The threads in the spiders that form the sequence of threads of maximum lengths are highlighted on the picture.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input file line contains one integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of spiders. Next *n* lines contain the descriptions of each spider: integer *n**i* (2<=\u2264<=*n**i*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of beads, then *n**i*<=-<=1 pairs of numbers denoting the numbers of the beads connected by threads. The beads that make up each spider are numbered from 1 to *n**i*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single number \u2014 the length of the required construction.\n\nDemo Input:\n['1\\n3 1 2 2 3\\n', '2\\n3 1 2 1 3\\n4 1 2 2 3 2 4\\n', '2\\n5 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 5\\n7 3 4 1 2 2 4 4 6 2 7 6 5\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '4\\n', '7\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

But Meg... what can you say, she wants everything simple. So, she already regards our planet as a two-dimensional circle. No, wait, it's even worse \u2014 as a square of side *n*. Thus, the task has been reduced to finding the shortest path between two dots on a square (the path should go through the square sides). To simplify the task let us consider the vertices of the square to lie at points whose coordinates are: (0,<=0), (*n*,<=0), (0,<=*n*) and (*n*,<=*n*).\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line contains 5 space-separated integers: *n*,<=*x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2 (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1000,<=0<=\u2264<=*x*1,<=*y*1,<=*x*2,<=*y*2<=\u2264<=*n*) which correspondingly represent a side of the square, the coordinates of the first point and the coordinates of the second point.

Let's number the problems with integers 1 through *m*. George estimates the *i*-th problem's complexity by integer *b**i*.\n\nTo make the round good, he needs to put at least *n* problems there. Besides, he needs to have at least one problem with complexity exactly *a*1, at least one with complexity exactly *a*2, ..., and at least one with complexity exactly *a**n*. Of course, the round can also have problems with other complexities.\n\nGeorge has a poor imagination. It's easier for him to make some already prepared problem simpler than to come up with a new one and prepare it. George is magnificent at simplifying problems. He can simplify any already prepared problem with complexity *c* to any positive integer complexity *d* (*c*<=\u2265<=*d*), by changing limits on the input data.\n\nHowever, nothing is so simple. George understood that even if he simplifies some problems, he can run out of problems for a good round.

For that, R2 uses a famous instant messaging program Spyke.\n\nR2 has *m* Spyke chats just to discuss all sorts of issues. In each chat, some group of employees exchanges messages daily. An employee can simultaneously talk in multiple chats. If some employee is in the *k*-th chat, he can write messages to this chat and receive notifications about messages from this chat. If an employee writes a message in the chat, all other participants of the chat receive a message notification.\n\nThe R2 company is conducting an audit.

All files are split to fragments and each of them are written in some sector of hard drive. Note the fragments can be written in sectors in arbitrary order.\n\nOne of the problems of HDD hard drives is the following: the magnetic head should move from one sector to another to read some file.\n\nFind the time need to read file split to *n* fragments. The *i*-th sector contains the *f**i*-th fragment of the file (1<=\u2264<=*f**i*<=\u2264<=*n*). Note different sectors contains the different fragments. At the start the magnetic head is in the position that contains the first fragment. The file are reading in the following manner: at first the first fragment is read, then the magnetic head moves to the sector that contains the second fragment, then the second fragment is read and so on until the *n*-th fragment is read. The fragments are read in the order from the first to the *n*-th.\n\nIt takes |*a*<=-<=*b*| time units to move the magnetic head from the sector *a* to the sector *b*. Reading a fragment takes no time.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains a positive integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of fragments.\n\nThe second line contains *n* different integers *f**i* (1<=\u2264<=*f**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of the fragment written in the *i*-th sector.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the only integer \u2014 the number of time units needed to read the file.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3\\n3 1 2\\n', '5\\n1 3 5 4 2\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['3\\n', '10\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the second example the head moves in the following way:\n -  1-&gt;2 means movement from the sector 1 to the sector 5, i.e. it takes 4 time units -  2-&gt;3 means movement from the sector 5 to the sector 2, i.e. it takes 3 time units -  3-&gt;4 means movement from the sector 2 to the sector 4, i.e. it takes 2 time units -  4-&gt;5 means movement from the sector 4 to the sector 3, i.e. it takes 1 time units \nSo the answer to the second example is 4\u2009+\u20093\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20091\u2009=\u200910.",

(easy)\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nHeidi's friend Jenny is asking Heidi to deliver an important letter to one of their common friends. Since Jenny is Irish, Heidi thinks that this might be a prank. More precisely, she suspects that the message she is asked to deliver states: \"Send the fool further!\", and upon reading it the recipient will ask Heidi to deliver the same message to yet another friend (that the recipient has in common with Heidi), and so on.\n\nHeidi believes that her friends want to avoid awkward situations, so she will not be made to visit the same person (including Jenny) twice. She also knows how much it costs to travel between any two of her friends who know each other. She wants to know: what is the maximal amount of money she will waste on travel if it really is a prank?\n\nHeidi's *n* friends are labeled 0 through *n*<=-<=1, and their network of connections forms a tree. In other words, every two of her friends *a*, *b* know each other, possibly indirectly (there is a sequence of friends starting from *a* and ending on *b* and such that each two consecutive friends in the sequence know each other directly), and there are exactly *n*<=-<=1 pairs of friends who know each other directly.\n\nJenny is given the number 0.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains the number of friends *n* (3<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100).

        "prompt": "Title: Sereja and Contests\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nSereja is a coder and he likes to take part in Codesorfes rounds. However, Uzhland doesn't have good internet connection, so Sereja sometimes skips rounds.\n\nCodesorfes has rounds of two types: *Div*1 (for advanced coders) and *Div*2 (for beginner coders). Two rounds, *Div*1 and *Div*2, can go simultaneously, (*Div*1 round cannot be held without *Div*2) in all other cases the rounds don't overlap in time. Each round has a unique identifier \u2014 a positive integer. The rounds are sequentially (without gaps) numbered with identifiers by the starting time of the round. The identifiers of rounds that are run simultaneously are different by one, also the identifier of the *Div*1 round is always greater.\n\nSereja is a beginner coder, so he can take part only in rounds of *Div*2 type. At the moment he is taking part in a *Div*2 round, its identifier equals to *x*. Sereja remembers very well that he has taken part in exactly *k* rounds before this round. Also, he remembers all identifiers of the rounds he has taken part in and all identifiers of the rounds that went simultaneously with them. Sereja doesn't remember anything about the rounds he missed.\n\nSereja is wondering: what minimum and what maximum number of *Div*2 rounds could he have missed? Help him find these two numbers.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers: *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=4000) \u2014 the round Sereja is taking part in today, and *k* (0<=\u2264<=*k*<=&lt;<=4000) \u2014 the number of rounds he took part in.\n\nNext *k* lines contain the descriptions of the rounds that Sereja took part in before. If Sereja took part in one of two simultaneous rounds, the corresponding line looks like: \"1 *num*2 *num*1\" (where *num*2 is the identifier of this *Div*2 round, *num*1 is the identifier of the *Div*1 round). It is guaranteed that *num*1<=-<=*num*2<==<=1. If Sereja took part in a usual *Div*2 round, then the corresponding line looks like: \"2 *num*\" (where *num* is the identifier of this *Div*2 round). It is guaranteed that the identifiers of all given rounds are less than *x*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint in a single line two integers \u2014 the minimum and the maximum number of rounds that Sereja could have missed.\n\nDemo Input:\n['3 2\\n2 1\\n2 2\\n', '9 3\\n1 2 3\\n2 8\\n1 4 5\\n', '10 0\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['0 0', '2 3', '5 9']\n\nNote:\nIn the second sample we have unused identifiers of rounds 1, 6, 7. The minimum number of rounds Sereja could have missed equals to 2. In this case, the round with the identifier 1 will be a usual *Div*2 round and the round with identifier 6 will be synchronous with the *Div*1 round. \n\nThe maximum number of rounds equals 3. In this case all unused identifiers belong to usual *Div*2 rounds.",

The King of Berland adored math. That's why, when he first visited one of his many palaces, he first of all paid attention to the floor in one hall. The floor was tiled with hexagonal tiles.\n\nThe hall also turned out hexagonal in its shape. The King walked along the perimeter of the hall and concluded that each of the six sides has *a*, *b*, *c*, *a*, *b* and *c* adjacent tiles, correspondingly.\n\nTo better visualize the situation, look at the picture showing a similar hexagon for *a*<==<=2, *b*<==<=3 and *c*<==<=4.\n\nAccording to the legend, as the King of Berland obtained the values *a*, *b* and *c*, he almost immediately calculated the total number of tiles on the hall floor.

        "prompt": "Title: Shopping\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nAyush is a cashier at the shopping center. Recently his department has started a ''click and collect\" service which allows users to shop online. \n\nThe store contains *k* items. *n* customers have already used the above service. Each user paid for *m* items. Let *a**ij* denote the *j*-th item in the *i*-th person's order.\n\nDue to the space limitations all the items are arranged in one single row. When Ayush receives the *i*-th order he will find one by one all the items *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*m*) in the row. Let *pos*(*x*) denote the position of the item *x* in the row at the moment of its collection. Then Ayush takes time equal to *pos*(*a**i*1)<=+<=*pos*(*a**i*2)<=+<=...<=+<=*pos*(*a**im*) for the *i*-th customer.\n\nWhen Ayush accesses the *x*-th element he keeps a new stock in the front of the row and takes away the *x*-th element. Thus the values are updating.\n\nYour task is to calculate the total time it takes for Ayush to process all the orders.\n\nYou can assume that the market has endless stock.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers *n*, *m* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*k*<=\u2264<=100,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=*k*) \u2014 the number of users, the number of items each user wants to buy and the total number of items at the market.\n\nThe next line contains *k* distinct integers *p**l* (1<=\u2264<=*p**l*<=\u2264<=*k*) denoting the initial positions of the items in the store. The items are numbered with integers from 1 to *k*.\n\nEach of the next *n* lines contains *m* distinct integers *a**ij* (1<=\u2264<=*a**ij*<=\u2264<=*k*) \u2014 the order of the *i*-th person.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the only integer *t* \u2014 the total time needed for Ayush to process all the orders.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 2 5\\n3 4 1 2 5\\n1 5\\n3 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['14\\n']\n\nNote:\nCustomer 1 wants the items 1 and 5.\n\n*pos*(1)\u2009=\u20093, so the new positions are: [1,\u20093,\u20094,\u20092,\u20095].\n\n*pos*(5)\u2009=\u20095, so the new positions are: [5,\u20091,\u20093,\u20094,\u20092].\n\nTime taken for the first customer is 3\u2009+\u20095\u2009=\u20098.\n\nCustomer 2 wants the items 3 and 1.\n\n*pos*(3)\u2009=\u20093, so the new positions are: [3,\u20095,\u20091,\u20094,\u20092].\n\n*pos*(1)\u2009=\u20093, so the new positions are: [1,\u20093,\u20095,\u20094,\u20092].\n\nTime taken for the second customer is 3\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u20096.\n\nTotal time is 8\u2009+\u20096\u2009=\u200914.\n\nFormally *pos*(*x*) is the index of *x* in the current row.",

        "prompt": "Title: Email address\n\nTime Limit: 2 seconds\n\nMemory Limit: 256 megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nSometimes one has to spell email addresses over the phone. Then one usually pronounces a dot as dot, an at sign as at. As a result, we get something like vasyaatgmaildotcom. Your task is to transform it into a proper email address ([[email\u00a0protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)). \n\nIt is known that a proper email address contains only such symbols as . @ and lower-case Latin letters, doesn't start with and doesn't end with a dot. Also, a proper email address doesn't start with and doesn't end with an at sign. Moreover, an email address contains exactly one such symbol as @, yet may contain any number (possible, zero) of dots. \n\nYou have to carry out a series of replacements so that the length of the result was as short as possible and it was a proper email address. If the lengths are equal, you should print the lexicographically minimal result. \n\nOverall, two variants of replacement are possible: dot can be replaced by a dot, at can be replaced by an at.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains the email address description. It is guaranteed that that is a proper email address with all the dots replaced by dot an the at signs replaced by at. The line is not empty and its length does not exceed 100 symbols.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint the shortest email address, from which the given line could be made by the described above replacements. If there are several solutions to that problem, print the lexicographically minimal one (the lexicographical comparison of the lines are implemented with an operator &lt; in modern programming languages).\n\nIn the ASCII table the symbols go in this order: . @ ab...z\n\nDemo Input:\n['vasyaatgmaildotcom\\n', 'dotdotdotatdotdotat\\n', 'aatt\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['[email\\xa0protected]\\n', '[email\\xa0protected]\\n', 'a@t\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

In this calendar there are 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 in June, 31 in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, 31 in December.\n\nA year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or is divisible by 400. For example, the following years are leap: 2000, 2004, but years 1900 and 2018 are not leap.\n\nIn this problem you are given *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=24) integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n*, and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of *n* consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is *a*1 days, duration of the next month is *a*2 days, and so on.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains single integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=24) \u2014 the number of integers.\n\nThe second line contains *n* integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (28<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=31) \u2014 the numbers you are to check.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print \"YES\" (without quotes).

Berland students are so tough that all they drink is orange juice!\n\nYesterday one student, Vasya and his mates made some barbecue and they drank this healthy drink only. After they ran out of the first barrel of juice, they decided to play a simple game. All *n* people who came to the barbecue sat in a circle (thus each person received a unique index *b**i* from 0 to *n*<=-<=1). The person number 0 started the game (this time it was Vasya). All turns in the game were numbered by integers starting from 1.

However, Vasya's got the recorded sequence of all the participants' actions (including himself). Now Vasya wants to find out the maximum amount of juice he could drink if he played optimally well (the other players' actions do not change).

For example, if *s*=\u00ababa\u00bb, then strings \u00abbaobab\u00bb, \u00abaabbaa\u00bb, \u00abhelloabahello\u00bb make him very happy and strings \u00abaab\u00bb, \u00abbaaa\u00bb and \u00abhelloabhello\u00bb do not.\n\nHowever rather than being happy once, he loves twice as much being happy twice!

In particular, one of the nights impressed her deeply, giving her the illusion that all her fancies would be realized.\n\nOn that night, Sengoku constructed a permutation *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* of integers from 1 to *n* inclusive, with each integer representing a colour, wishing for the colours to see in the coming meteor outburst. Two incredible outbursts then arrived, each with *n* meteorids, colours of which being integer sequences *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* and *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* respectively. Meteoroids' colours were also between 1 and *n* inclusive, and the two sequences were not identical, that is, at least one *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) exists, such that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i* holds.\n\nWell, she almost had it all \u2014 each of the sequences *a* and *b* matched exactly *n*<=-<=1 elements in Sengoku's permutation. In other words, there is exactly one *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) such that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*p**i*, and exactly one *j* (1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*n*) such that *b**j*<=\u2260<=*p**j*.\n\nFor now, Sengoku is able to recover the actual colour sequences *a* and *b* through astronomical records, but her wishes have been long forgotten. You are to reconstruct any possible permutation Sengoku could have had on that night.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer *n* (2<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=1<=000) \u2014 the length of Sengoku's permutation, being the length of both meteor outbursts at the same time.\n\nThe second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*1,<=*a*2,<=...,<=*a**n* (1<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the sequence of colours in the first meteor outburst.\n\nThe third line contains *n* space-separated integers *b*1,<=*b*2,<=...,<=*b**n* (1<=\u2264<=*b**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the sequence of colours in the second meteor outburst. At least one *i* (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) exists, such that *a**i*<=\u2260<=*b**i* holds.\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput *n* space-separated integers *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n*, denoting a possible permutation Sengoku could have had.

The tables consist of zeroes and ones. We will consider the rows and columns of both tables indexed starting from 1. Then we will define the element of the first table, located at the intersection of the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column, as *a**i*,<=*j*; we will define the element of the second table, located at the intersection of the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column, as *b**i*,<=*j*. \n\nWe will call the pair of integers (*x*,<=*y*) a shift of the second table relative to the first one. We'll call the overlap factor of the shift (*x*,<=*y*) value:\n\nwhere the variables *i*,<=*j* take only such values, in which the expression *a**i*,<=*j*\u00b7*b**i*<=+<=*x*,<=*j*<=+<=*y* makes sense. More formally, inequalities 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n**a*,<=1<=\u2264<=*j*<=\u2264<=*m**a*,<=1<=\u2264<=*i*<=+<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n**b*,<=1<=\u2264<=*j*<=+<=*y*<=\u2264<=*m**b* must hold. If there are no values of variables *i*,<=*j*, that satisfy the given inequalities, the value of the sum is considered equal to 0. \n\nYour task is to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor among all possible shifts.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers *n**a*,<=*m**a* (1<=\u2264<=*n**a*,<=*m**a*<=\u2264<=50) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the first table. Then *n**a* lines contain *m**a* characters each \u2014 the elements of the first table.

Then follow the elements of the second table in the format, similar to the first table.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the first table has at least one number \"1\". It is guaranteed that the second table has at least one number \"1\".\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint two space-separated integers *x*,<=*y* (|*x*|,<=|*y*|<=\u2264<=109) \u2014 a shift with maximum overlap factor.

But doing nothing the whole day turned out to be too boring, and he decided to play a game with pebbles. Initially, the Beaver has *n* pebbles. He arranges them in *a* equal rows, each row has *b* pebbles (*a*<=&gt;<=1). Note that the Beaver must use all the pebbles he has, i. e. *n*<==<=*a*\u00b7*b*.\n\nOnce the Smart Beaver has arranged the pebbles, he takes back any of the resulting rows (that is, *b* pebbles) and discards all other pebbles. Then he arranges all his pebbles again (possibly choosing other values of *a* and *b*) and takes back one row, and so on. The game continues until at some point the Beaver ends up with exactly one pebble. \n\nThe game process can be represented as a finite sequence of integers *c*1,<=...,<=*c**k*, where: \n -  *c*1<==<=*n* -  *c**i*<=+<=1 is the number of pebbles that the Beaver ends up with after the *i*-th move, that is, the number of pebbles in a row after some arrangement of *c**i* pebbles (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*k*). Note that *c**i*<=&gt;<=*c**i*<=+<=1. -  *c**k*<==<=1 \nThe result of the game is the sum of numbers *c**i*. You are given *n*.

He boasted to a friend Arkady about winning as much as *x* points for his first contest. But Arkady did not believe his friend's words and decided to check whether Valera could have shown such a result.\n\nHe knows that the contest number 300 was unusual because there were only two problems. The contest lasted for *t* minutes, the minutes are numbered starting from zero. The first problem had the initial cost of *a* points, and every minute its cost reduced by *d**a* points. The second problem had the initial cost of *b* points, and every minute this cost reduced by *d**b* points. Thus, as soon as the zero minute of the contest is over, the first problem will cost *a*<=-<=*d**a* points, and the second problem will cost *b*<=-<=*d**b* points. It is guaranteed that at any moment of the contest each problem has a non-negative cost.\n\nArkady asks you to find out whether Valera could have got exactly *x* points for this contest. You should assume that Valera could have solved any number of the offered problems. You should also assume that for each problem Valera made no more than one attempt, besides, he could have submitted both problems at the same minute of the contest, starting with minute 0 and ending with minute number *t*<=-<=1. Please note that Valera can't submit a solution exactly *t* minutes after the start of the contest or later.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe single line of the input contains six integers *x*,<=*t*,<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*d**a*,<=*d**b* (0<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=600;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*t*,<=*a*,<=*b*,<=*d**a*,<=*d**b*<=\u2264<=300) \u2014 Valera's result, the contest's duration, the initial cost of the first problem, the initial cost of the second problem, the number of points that the first and the second problem lose per minute, correspondingly.\n\nIt is guaranteed that at each minute of the contest each problem has a non-negative cost, that is, *a*<=-<=*i*\u00b7*d**a*<=\u2265<=0 and *b*<=-<=*i*\u00b7*d**b*<=\u2265<=0 for all 0<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*t*<=-<=1.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf Valera could have earned exactly *x* points at a contest, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\nDemo Input:\n['30 5 20 20 3 5\\n', '10 4 100 5 5 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['YES\\n', 'NO\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first sample Valera could have acted like this: he could have submitted the first problem at minute 0 and the second problem \u2014 at minute 2.

        "prompt": "Title: Devu, the Dumb Guy\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nDevu is a dumb guy, his learning curve is very slow. You are supposed to teach him *n* subjects, the *i**th* subject has *c**i* chapters. When you teach him, you are supposed to teach all the chapters of a subject continuously.\n\nLet us say that his initial per chapter learning power of a subject is *x* hours. In other words he can learn a chapter of a particular subject in *x* hours.\n\nWell Devu is not complete dumb, there is a good thing about him too. If you teach him a subject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will require exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to understand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not be less than 1 hour.\n\nYou can teach him the *n* subjects in any possible order. Find out minimum amount of time (in hours) Devu will take to understand all the subjects and you will be free to do some enjoying task rather than teaching a dumb guy.\n\nPlease be careful that answer might not fit in 32 bit data type.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line will contain two space separated integers *n*, *x* (1<=\u2264<=*n*,<=*x*<=\u2264<=105). The next line will contain *n* space separated integers: *c*1,<=*c*2,<=...,<=*c**n* (1<=\u2264<=*c**i*<=\u2264<=105).\n\nOutput Specification:\nOutput a single integer representing the answer to the problem.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 3\\n4 1\\n', '4 2\\n5 1 2 1\\n', '3 3\\n1 1 1\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['11\\n', '10\\n', '6\\n']\n\nNote:\nLook at the first example. Consider the order of subjects: 1, 2. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 12 hours to teach first subject. After teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him second subject will take 2\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20092 hours. Hence you will need to spend 12\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u200914 hours.\n\nConsider the order of subjects: 2, 1. When you teach Devu the second subject, then it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20093 hours to teach the second subject. After teaching the second subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching him the first subject will take 2\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009=\u20098 hours. Hence you will need to spend 11 hours.\n\nSo overall, minimum of both the cases is 11 hours.\n\nLook at the third example. The order in this example doesn't matter. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the second subject, it will take him 2 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the third subject, it will take him 1 hours per chapter. In total it takes 6 hours.",

        "prompt": "Title: Summer sell-off\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nSummer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.\n\nShop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following *n* days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in *i*-th day *k**i* products will be put up for sale and exactly *l**i* clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any *f* days from *n* next for sell-outs. On each of *f* chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on *i*-th day shop planned to put up for sale *k**i* products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7*k**i* products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.\n\nNoora's task is to choose *f* days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains two integers *n* and *f* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=0<=\u2264<=*f*<=\u2264<=*n*) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.\n\nEach line of the following *n* subsequent lines contains two integers *k**i*,<=*l**i* (0<=\u2264<=*k**i*,<=*l**i*<=\u2264<=109) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the *i*-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on *i*-th day.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.\n\nDemo Input:\n['4 2\\n2 1\\n3 5\\n2 3\\n1 5\\n', '4 1\\n0 2\\n0 3\\n3 5\\n0 6\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['10', '5']\n\nNote:\nIn the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2,\u20096,\u20092,\u20092] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second\u00a0\u2014 5, on the third\u00a0\u2014 2, on the fourth\u00a0\u2014 2. In total 1\u2009+\u20095\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u200910 product units.\n\nIn the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.",

        "prompt": "Title: Find Marble\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPetya and Vasya are playing a game. Petya's got *n* non-transparent glasses, standing in a row. The glasses' positions are indexed with integers from 1 to *n* from left to right. Note that the positions are indexed but the glasses are not.\n\nFirst Petya puts a marble under the glass in position *s*. Then he performs some (possibly zero) shuffling operations. One shuffling operation means moving the glass from the first position to position *p*1, the glass from the second position to position *p*2 and so on. That is, a glass goes from position *i* to position *p**i*. Consider all glasses are moving simultaneously during one shuffling operation. When the glasses are shuffled, the marble doesn't travel from one glass to another: it moves together with the glass it was initially been put in.\n\nAfter all shuffling operations Petya shows Vasya that the ball has moved to position *t*. Vasya's task is to say what minimum number of shuffling operations Petya has performed or determine that Petya has made a mistake and the marble could not have got from position *s* to position *t*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains three integers: *n*,<=*s*,<=*t* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105;\u00a01<=\u2264<=*s*,<=*t*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the number of glasses, the ball's initial and final position. The second line contains *n* space-separated integers: *p*1,<=*p*2,<=...,<=*p**n* (1<=\u2264<=*p**i*<=\u2264<=*n*) \u2014 the shuffling operation parameters. It is guaranteed that all *p**i*'s are distinct.\n\nNote that *s* can equal *t*.\n\nOutput Specification:\nIf the marble can move from position *s* to position *t*, then print on a single line a non-negative integer \u2014 the minimum number of shuffling operations, needed to get the marble to position *t*.

        "prompt": "Title: More Cowbell\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nKevin Sun wants to move his precious collection of *n* cowbells from Naperthrill to Exeter, where there is actually grass instead of corn. Before moving, he must pack his cowbells into *k* boxes of a fixed size. In order to keep his collection safe during transportation, he won't place more than two cowbells into a single box. Since Kevin wishes to minimize expenses, he is curious about the smallest size box he can use to pack his entire collection. \n\nKevin is a meticulous cowbell collector and knows that the size of his *i*-th (1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*) cowbell is an integer *s**i*. In fact, he keeps his cowbells sorted by size, so *s**i*<=-<=1<=\u2264<=*s**i* for any *i*<=&gt;<=1. Also an expert packer, Kevin can fit one or two cowbells into a box of size *s* if and only if the sum of their sizes does not exceed *s*. Given this information, help Kevin determine the smallest *s* for which it is possible to put all of his cowbells into *k* boxes of size *s*.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=2\u00b7*k*<=\u2264<=100<=000), denoting the number of cowbells and the number of boxes, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains *n* space-separated integers *s*1,<=*s*2,<=...,<=*s**n* (1<=\u2264<=*s*1<=\u2264<=*s*2<=\u2264<=...<=\u2264<=*s**n*<=\u2264<=1<=000<=000), the sizes of Kevin's cowbells.

Their language consists of *n* words numbered from 1 to *n*. Some words have the same meaning so there are *k* groups of words such that all the words in some group have the same meaning.\n\nMahmoud knows that the *i*-th word can be sent with cost *a**i*. For each word in his message, Mahmoud can either replace it with another word of the same meaning or leave it as it is. Can you help Mahmoud determine the minimum cost of sending the message?\n\nThe cost of sending the message is the sum of the costs of sending every word in it.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of input contains integers *n*, *k* and *m* (1<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105,<=1<=\u2264<=*m*<=\u2264<=105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of words in their language, the number of groups of words, and the number of words in Mahmoud's message respectively.\n\nThe second line contains *n* strings consisting of lowercase English letters of length not exceeding 20 which represent the words.

The next *k* lines each start with an integer *x* (1<=\u2264<=*x*<=\u2264<=*n*) which means that there are *x* words in this group, followed by *x* integers which represent the indices of words in this group. It's guaranteed that each word appears in exactly one group.\n\nThe next line contains *m* space-separated words which represent Mahmoud's message.

After thinking about where to travel this time, she chose XXX\u00a0\u2014 beautiful, but little-known northern country.\n\nHere are some interesting facts about XXX:\n 1.  XXX consists of *n* cities, *k* of whose (just imagine!) are capital cities. 1.  All of cities in the country are beautiful, but each is beautiful in its own way. Beauty value of *i*-th city equals to *c**i*. 1.  All the cities are consecutively connected by the roads, including 1-st and *n*-th city, forming a cyclic route 1<=\u2014<=2<=\u2014<=...<=\u2014<=*n*<=\u2014<=1. Formally, for every 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=&lt;<=*n* there is a road between *i*-th and *i*<=+<=1-th city, and another one between 1-st and *n*-th city. 1.  Each capital city is connected with each other city directly by the roads. Formally, if city *x* is a capital city, then for every 1<=\u2264<=*i*<=\u2264<=*n*,<=<=*i*<=\u2260<=*x*, there is a road between cities *x* and *i*. 1.  There is at most one road between any two cities. 1.  Price of passing a road directly depends on beauty values of cities it connects. Thus if there is a road between cities *i* and *j*, price of passing it equals *c**i*\u00b7*c**j*.\nMishka started to gather her things for a trip, but didn't still decide which route to follow and thus she asked you to help her determine summary price of passing each of the roads in XXX. Formally, for every pair of cities *a* and *b* (*a*<=&lt;<=*b*), such that there is a road between *a* and *b* you are to find sum of products *c**a*\u00b7*c**b*.

        "prompt": "Title: Developing Skills\n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nPetya loves computer games. Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!\n\nThe main character of this game has *n* different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer *a**i* from 0 to 100. The higher the number *a**i* is, the higher is the *i*-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values \u200b\u200bof  for all *i* from 1 to *n*. The expression \u230a *x*\u230b denotes the result of rounding the number *x* down to the nearest integer.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Petya got *k* improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if *a*4<==<=46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line of the input contains two positive integers *n* and *k* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105, 0<=\u2264<=*k*<=\u2264<=107) \u2014 the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a sequence of *n* integers *a**i* (0<=\u2264<=*a**i*<=\u2264<=100), where *a**i* characterizes the level of the *i*-th skill of the character.\n\nOutput Specification:\nThe first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer \u2014 the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using *k* or less improvement units.\n\nDemo Input:\n['2 4\\n7 9\\n', '3 8\\n17 15 19\\n', '2 2\\n99 100\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['2\\n', '5\\n', '20\\n']\n\nNote:\nIn the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor*\u2009+\u2009 *lfloor* *frac*{100}{10} *rfloor*\u2009=\u200910\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u2009 20.\n\nIn the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ccaa4e1e435ea3a339c322e03a32de69d214a257.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.\n\nIn the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b246630ca7d1b95b91970759bd8455cb3e930bf9.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.",

        "prompt": "Title: Lefthanders and Righthanders \n\nTime Limit: None seconds\n\nMemory Limit: None megabytes\n\nProblem Description:\nOne fine October day a mathematics teacher Vasily Petrov went to a class and saw there *n* pupils who sat at the  desks, two people at each desk. Vasily quickly realized that number *n* is even. Like all true mathematicians, Vasily has all students numbered from 1 to *n*.\n\nBut Vasily Petrov did not like the way the children were seated at the desks. According to him, the students whose numbers differ by 1, can not sit together, as they talk to each other all the time, distract others and misbehave.\n\nOn the other hand, if a righthanded student sits at the left end of the desk and a lefthanded student sits at the right end of the desk, they hit elbows all the time and distract each other. In other cases, the students who sit at the same desk, do not interfere with each other.\n\nVasily knows very well which students are lefthanders and which ones are righthanders, and he asks you to come up with any order that meets these two uncomplicated conditions (students do not talk to each other and do not bump their elbows). It is guaranteed that the input is such that at least one way to seat the students always exists.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first input line contains a single even integer *n* (4<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=100) \u2014 the number of students in the class. The second line contains exactly *n* capital English letters \"L\" and \"R\". If the *i*-th letter at the second line equals \"L\", then the student number *i* is a lefthander, otherwise he is a righthander.\n\nOutput Specification:\nPrint  integer pairs, one pair per line. In the *i*-th line print the numbers of students that will sit at the *i*-th desk. The first number in the pair stands for the student who is sitting to the left, and the second number stands for the student who is sitting to the right. Separate the numbers in the pairs by spaces. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nDemo Input:\n['6\\nLLRLLL\\n', '4\\nRRLL\\n']\n\nDemo Output:\n['1 4\\n2 5\\n6 3\\n', '3 1\\n4 2\\n']\n\nNote:\nnone",

The second part is an inner disk with radius *r*2 cm, it is made of metal with density *p*2 g/cm3. The disk is nested inside the ring.\n\nThe Olympic jury decided that *r*1 will take one of possible values of *x*1,<=*x*2,<=...,<=*x**n*. It is up to jury to decide which particular value *r*1 will take. Similarly, the Olympic jury decided that *p*1 will take one of possible value of *y*1,<=*y*2,<=...,<=*y**m*, and *p*2 will take a value from list *z*1,<=*z*2,<=...,<=*z**k*.\n\nAccording to most ancient traditions the ratio between the outer ring mass *m**out* and the inner disk mass *m**in* must equal , where *A*,<=*B* are constants taken from ancient books. Now, to start making medals, the jury needs to take values for *r*1, *p*1, *p*2 and calculate the suitable value of *r*2.\n\nThe jury wants to choose the value that would maximize radius *r*2. Help the jury find the sought value of *r*2.

Right now, he invented a new tree, called xor-tree. After this new revolutionary discovery, he invented a game for kids which uses xor-trees.\n\nThe game is played on a tree having *n* nodes, numbered from 1 to *n*. Each node *i* has an initial value *init**i*, which is either 0 or 1. The root of the tree is node 1.\n\nOne can perform several (possibly, zero) operations on the tree during the game. The only available type of operation is to pick a node *x*. Right after someone has picked node *x*, the value of node *x* flips, the values of sons of *x* remain the same, the values of sons of sons of *x* flips, the values of sons of sons of sons of *x* remain the same and so on.\n\nThe goal of the game is to get each node *i* to have value *goal**i*, which can also be only 0 or 1. You need to reach the goal of the game by using minimum number of operations.\n\nInput Specification:\nThe first line contains an integer *n* (1<=\u2264<=*n*<=\u2264<=105).

The following line also contains *n* integer numbers, the *i*-th number corresponds to *goal**i* (*goal**i* is either 0 or 1).\n\nOutput Specification:\nIn the first line output an integer number *cnt*, representing the minimal number of operations you perform.
